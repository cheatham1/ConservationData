0	36196931	Observations of hypomelanosis in the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum.	Hypomelanosis refers to a suite of skin pigment abnormalities, including albinism, leucism, and piebaldism. While documented across many vertebrate species, examples of hypomelanosis are rarely seen in chondrichthyans, with little insight into the potential effects on survival. Here, we report the first observation of abnormal skin pigmentation indicative of piebaldism in the Atlantic nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum, representing only the second reported case of skin aberrations for this species. This extremely rare observation is discussed in the broader context of fitness variation and long-term survival. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Catch-and-release fishing is an important component of ecotourism industries and scientific research worldwide, but its total impact on animal physiology, health and survival is understudied for many species of fishes, particularly sharks. We combined biologging and blood chemistry to explore how this fisheries interaction influenced the physiology of two widely distributed, highly migratory shark species: the blue shark (

Global declines in elasmobranch populations resulting from several stressors raises conservation concern. Additionally, apex predators bioaccumulate high concentrations of total mercury (THg), due to biomagnification. Although South Africa is considered one of the top ten contributors of Hg emissions globally, information on Hg concentrations in elasmobranchs is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the THg concentrations in 22 species of elasmobranchs along the South African coastline. Concentrations ranged between 0.22 and 5.8 mg/kg in Haploblepharus pictus (dark shysharks) and Rostroraja alba (white skates) on the south coast, respectively. Along the east coast it ranged between 0.21 and 17.8 mg/kg in Mobula kuhlii (shortfin devil rays) and Sphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerheads), respectively. Mercury concentrations on the east coast were in the same range or higher compared to the same species sampled between 2005-10 from the same region, with generally higher concentrations compared to the same species sampled globally.
5	36178940	A multi-method characterization of Elasmobranch & Cheloniidae communities of the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba.	The Red Sea is particularly biodiverse, hosting high levels of endemism and numerous populations whose extinction risk is heightened by their relative isolation. Elasmobranchs and sea turtles have likely suffered recent declines in this region, although data on their distribution and biology are severely lacking, especially on the eastern side of the basin in Saudi Arabian waters. Here, we present sightings of elasmobranchs and sea turtles across the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba collected through a combination of survey methods. Over 455 survey hours, we recorded 407 sightings belonging to 26 elasmobranch species and two sea turtle species, more than 75% of which are of conservation concern. We identified 4 species of rays and 9 species of sharks not previously recorded in Saudi Arabia and report a range extension for the pink whipray (Himantura fai) and the round ribbontail ray (Taeniurops meyeni) into the Gulf of Aqaba. High density of sightings of conservation significance, including green and hawksbill sea turtles and halavi guitarfish were recorded in bay systems along the eastern Gulf of Aqaba and the Saudi Arabian coastline bordering the north-eastern Red Sea, and many carcharhinid species were encountered at offshore seamounts in the region. Our findings provide new insights into the distribution patterns of megafaunal assemblages over smaller spatial scales in the region, and facilitate future research and conservation efforts, amidst ongoing, large-scale coastal developments in the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba.
6	36177600	Non-autonomous cell death induced by the Draper phagocytosis receptor requires signaling through JNK and SRC pathways.	The last step of cell death is cell clearance, a process critical for tissue homeostasis. For efficient cell clearance to occur, phagocytes and dead cells need to reciprocally signal to each other. One important phenomenon that is under-investigated, however, is that phagocytes not only engulf corpses but contribute to cell death progression. The aims of this study were to determine how the phagocytic receptor Draper non-autonomously induces cell death, using the Drosophila ovary as a model system. We found that Draper, expressed in epithelial follicle cells, requires its intracellular signaling domain to kill the adjacent nurse cell population. Kinases Src, Shark and JNK were required for Draper-induced nurse cell death. Signs of nurse cell death occurred prior to apparent engulfment and required the caspase Dcp-1, indicating that it uses a similar apoptotic pathway as starvation-induced cell death. These findings indicate that active signaling by Draper is required to kill nurse cells via the caspase Dcp-1, providing novel insights into mechanisms of phagoptosis driven by non-professional phagocytes.
7	36177031	The influence of antibody humanization on shark variable domain (VNAR) binding site ensembles.	Sharks and other cartilaginous fish produce new antigen receptor (IgNAR) antibodies, as key part of their humoral immune response and are the phylogenetically oldest living organisms that possess an immunoglobulin (Ig)-based adaptive immune system. IgNAR antibodies are naturally occurring heavy-chain-only antibodies, that recognize antigens with their single domain variable regions (VNARs). In this study, we structurally and biophysically elucidate the effect of antibody humanization of a previously published spiny dogfish VNAR (parent E06), which binds with high affinity to the human serum albumin (HSA). We analyze different humanization variants together with the parental E06 VNAR and the human Vκ1 light chain germline DPK9 antibody to characterize the influence of point mutations in the framework and the antigen binding site on the specificity of VNARs as reported by Kovalenko et al. We find substantially higher flexibility in the humanized variants, reflected in a broader conformational space and a higher conformational entropy, as well as population shifts of the dominant binding site ensembles in solution. A further variant, in which some mutations are reverted, largely restores the conformational stability and the dominant binding minimum of the parent E06. We also identify differences in surface hydrophobicity between the human Vκ1 light chain germline DPK9 antibody, the parent VNAR E06 and the humanized variants. Additional simulations of VNAR-HSA complexes of the parent E06 VNAR and a humanized variant reveal that the parent VNAR features a substantially stronger network of stabilizing interactions. Thus, we conclude that a structural and dynamic understanding of the VNAR binding site upon humanization is a key aspect in antibody humanization.
8	36175455	Assessing a megadiverse but poorly known community of fishes in a tropical mangrove estuary through environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding.	Biodiversity surveys are crucial for monitoring the status of threatened aquatic ecosystems, such as tropical estuaries and mangroves. Conventional monitoring methods are intrusive, time-consuming, substantially expensive, and often provide only rough estimates in complex habitats. An advanced monitoring approach, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, is promising, although only few applications in tropical mangrove estuaries have been reported. In this study, we explore the advantages and limitations of an eDNA metabarcoding survey on the fish community of the Merbok Estuary (Peninsular Malaysia). COI and 12S eDNA metabarcoding assays collectively detected 178 species from 127 genera, 68 families, and 25 orders. Using this approach, significantly more species have been detected in the Merbok Estuary over the past decade (2010-2019) than in conventional surveys, including several species of conservation importance. However, we highlight three limitations: (1) in the absence of a comprehensive reference database the identities of several species are unresolved; (2) some of the previously documented specimen-based diversity was not captured by the current method, perhaps as a consequence of PCR primer specificity, and (3) the detection of non-resident species-stenohaline freshwater taxa (e.g., cyprinids, channids, osphronemids) and marine coral reef taxa (e.g., holocentrids, some syngnathids and sharks), not known to frequent estuaries, leading to the supposition that their DNA have drifted into the estuary through water movements. The community analysis revealed that fish diversity along the Merbok Estuary is not homogenous, with the upstream more diverse than further downstream. This could be due to the different landscapes or degree of anthropogenic influences along the estuary. In summary, we demonstrated the practicality of eDNA metabarcoding in assessing fish community and structure within a complex and rich tropical environment within a short sampling period. However, some limitations need to be considered and addressed to fully exploit the efficacy of this approach.
9	36169148	Morphometric analysis of the elasmobranch olfactory rosette.	The olfactory rosettes of elasmobranchs vary in shape and structure among species, but the functional consequences of this diversity are unresolved. Our goal was to quantify rosette morphology on dissected as well as diceCT-imaged specimens to analyze the drivers of observed trends in a phylogenetic context and compare the methodologies. We hypothesized that lamellar count and rosette shape (fineness ratio) would not scale with animal size, but other rosette size variables would scale positively. We dissected rosettes from 14 elasmobranch species and collected morphometric data (fineness ratio, lamellar count, interlamellar distance, lamellar thickness, and raphe width). A subset of rosettes (5 species) were used to analyze the effects of body size, while all 14 species were used for a phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA). We found that fineness ratio and lamellar counts varied significantly among species, and were positively correlated. The first two principal components of the pPCA explained 82% of the variation, with fineness ratio and lamellar count contributing most to the loadings, respectively. Diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced CT (diceCT) was used for in situ imaging of four species of Carcharhiniformes. There were no significant differences between rosette structure or volume when comparing values from dissected specimens to values from in situ specimens obtained using diceCT. We also quantified the volume of the excurrent channel in the olfactory capsule. These data add to our understanding of how olfactory organ shape varies among species and can be used to create 3D models for future olfactory hydrodynamic studies.

10	36168768	Escape response kinematics in two species of tropical sharks: short escape latencies and high turning performance.	Accelerative manoeuvres, such as fast-starts, are crucial for fish to avoid predation. This escape responses include fundamental survival traits for prey that experience high predation pressure. However, no previous study has assessed escape performance in neonate tropical sharks. We quantitatively evaluated vulnerability traits of neonate tropical sharks by testing predictions on their fast-start escape performance. We predicted (1) high manoeuvrability, given their high flexibility, but (2) low propulsive locomotion due to the drag costs associated with pectoral fin extension during escape responses. Further, based on previous work on dogfish Squalus suckleyi, we predicted (3) long reaction times (as latencies longer than teleost,>20 ms). We used two-dimensional, high-speed videography analysis of mechano-acoustically stimulated neonate blacktip reef Carcharhinus melanopterus (n=12) and sicklefin lemon Negaprion acutidens (n=8) sharks. Both species performed a characteristic C-start double-bend response (i.e., two body bends), but single-bend responses were only observed in N. acutidens. As predicted, neonate sharks showed high manoeuvrability with high turning rates and tight turning radii (3-11% of body length) but low propulsive performance (i.e., speed, acceleration and velocity) when compared to similar-sized teleosts and S. suckleyi. Contrary to expectations, escape latencies were<20 ms in both species, suggesting that the neurophysiological system of sharks when reacting to a predatory attack may not be limited to long response times. These results provide a quantitative assessment of survival traits in neonate tropical sharks that will be crucial for future studies that consider the vulnerability of these sharks to predation.
11	36165921	Energetic consequences of resource use diversity in a marine carnivore.	Understanding how intraspecific variation in the use of prey resources impacts energy metabolism has strong implications for predicting long-term fitness and is critical for predicting population-to-community level responses to environmental change. Here, we examine the energetic consequences of variable prey resource use in a widely distributed marine carnivore, juvenile sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus). We used carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify three primary prey resource pools-demersal omnivores, pelagic forage, and benthic detritivores and estimated the proportional assimilation of each resource using Bayesian mixing models. We then quantified how the utilization of these resource pools impacted the concentrations of six plasma lipids and how this varied by ontogeny. Sharks exhibited variable reliance on two of three predominant prey resource pools: demersal omnivores and pelagic forage. Resource use variation was a strong predictor of energetic condition, whereby individuals more reliant upon pelagic forage exhibited higher blood plasma concentrations of very low-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These findings underscore how intraspecific variation in resource use may impact the energy metabolism of animals, and more broadly, that natural and anthropogenically driven fluctuations in prey resources could have longer term energetic consequences.
12	36162290	Microplastic contamination and risk assessment in blue shark (Prionace glauca) from the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.	We quantified the abundance and characteristics of microplastics in the blue shark, Prionace glauca, found in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and investigated the potential microplastic pollution risks. Microplastics (MPs) were detected in 39.1 % of specimens, up to 0.15 ± 0.38 items/g wet weight of the posterior part of the pylorus, and were sized 45.87 to 3220.12 μm. The majority were fibrous in shape (83.3 %) and blue in color (72.2 %). Both sexes of sharks had similar MP abundance and characteristics, except for polymers, with polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene representing the dominant type in males and females, respectively. Most individuals experienced low pollution, but one male P. glauca exhibited a high ecological risk level owing to the high MP abundance and detection of polyvinyl chloride. This study provides an important baseline for the ingestion of microplastics by pelagic shark species and is a preliminary quantitative measure that could be used in future studies of the risk of MPs.

14	36154243	Self-localization of buoyless fishing gear and other objects on the sea floor.	End lines used in commercial trap/pot fishing pose a significant entanglement risk to whales, sea turtles, and sharks. Removal of these ropes for buoyless fishing is being considered by the United States and Canadian governments, but a method to systematically locate the gear without an attached buoy is required. A method was developed for an acoustic modem to self-localize and broadcast its location to nearby ships to minimize gear conflict, optimize power consumption, and reduce lost gear. This method was implemented using a research modem that self-localized to within 5 m of its estimated location on the sea floor.

16	36147936	A general swimming response in exhausted obligate swimming fish.	Marine organisms normally swim at elevated speeds relative to cruising speeds only during strenuous activity, such as predation or escape. We measured swimming speeds of 29 ram ventilating sharks from 10 species and of three Atlantic bluefin tunas immediately after exhaustive exercise (fighting a capture by hook-and-line) and unexpectedly found all individuals exhibited a uniform mechanical response, with swimming speed initially two times higher than the cruising speeds reached approximately 6 h later. We hypothesized that elevated swimming behaviour is a means to increase energetic demand and drive the removal of lactate accumulated during capture via oxidation. To explore this hypothesis, we estimated the mechanical work that must have been spent by an animal to elevate its swim speed and then showed that the amount of lactate that could have been oxidized to fuel it comprises a significant portion of the amount of lactate normally observed in fishes after exhaustive exercise. An estimate for the full energetic cost of the catch-and-release event ensued.

The epidermal microbiome is a critical element of marine organismal immunity, but the epidermal virome of marine organisms remains largely unexplored. The epidermis of sharks represents a unique viromic ecosystem. Sharks secrete a thin layer of mucus which harbors a diverse microbiome, while their hydrodynamic dermal denticles simultaneously repel environmental microbes. Here, we sampled the virome from the epidermis of three shark species in the family

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the major target for antibody therapeutics. Shark-derived variable domains of new antigen receptors (VNARs) are the smallest antibody fragments with flexible paratopes that can recognize protein motifs inaccessible to classical antibodies. This study reported four VNARs binders (JM-2, JM-5, JM-17, and JM-18) isolated from

20	36135306	Ionogels Derived from Fluorinated Ionic Liquids to Enhance Aqueous Drug Solubility for Local Drug Administration.	Gelatin is a popular biopolymer for biomedical applications due to its harmless impact with a negligible inflammatory response in the host organism. Gelatin interacts with soluble molecules in aqueous media as ionic counterparts such as ionic liquids (ILs) to be used as cosolvents to generate the so-called Ionogels. The perfluorinated IL (FIL), 1-ethyl-3-methylpyridinium perfluorobutanesulfonate, has been selected as co-hydrosolvent for fish gelatin due to its low cytotoxicity and hydrophobicity aprotic polar structure to improve the drug aqueous solubility. A series of FIL/water emulsions with different FIL content and their corresponding shark gelatin/FIL Ionogel has been designed to enhance the drug solubility whilst retaining the mechanical structure and their nanostructure was probed by simultaneous SAXS/WAXS, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, DSC and rheological experiments. Likewise, the FIL assisted the solubility of the antitumoural Doxorubicin whilst retaining the performing mechanical properties of the drug delivery system network for the drug storage as well as the local administration by a syringe. In addition, the different controlled release mechanisms of two different antitumoral such as Doxorubicin and Mithramycin from two different Ionogels formulations were compared to previous gelatin hydrogels which proved the key structure correlation required to attain specific therapeutic dosages.

22	36130072	Genital mycobacteriosis caused by Mycobacterium marinum detected in two captive sharks by peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization.	Mycobacterium marinum is a prevalent nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM)-infecting teleosts. Conversely, little is known about mycobacteriosis in elasmobranchs, and M. marinum infection has never been reported from the subclass. This study investigated the histopathological characteristics and localization of this mycobacterium through molecular analysis of two captive sharks, a scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini and a Japanese bullhead shark Heterodontus japonicus, exhibited in the same aquarium tank. We detected genital mycobacteriosis caused by M. marinum infection using molecular analyses, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing targeting the 60 kDa heat-shock protein gene (hsp65), and peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Both sharks showed granulomas in connective tissues of the gonads without central necrosis or surrounding fibrous capsules, which is unlike the typical mycobacterial granulomas seen in teleosts. This study reveals that elasmobranchs can be aquatic hosts of M. marinum. Because M. marinum is a representative waterborne NTM and a potential zoonotic agent, cautious and intensive research is needed to overcome a lack of data on the relationship between NTM and the aquatic environment in association with this subclass of Chondrichthyes.
23	36128705	Bioapatite in shark centra studied by wide-angle and by small-angle X-ray scattering.	Members of subclass Elasmobranchii possess cartilage skeletons; the centra of many species are mineralized with a bioapatite, but virtually nothing is known about the mineral's organization. This study employed high-energy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS, i.e. X-ray diffraction) to investigate the bioapatite crystallography within blocks cut from centra of four species (two carcharhiniform families, one lamniform family and 1-ID of the Advanced Photon Source). All species' crystallographic quantities closely matched and indicated a bioapatite closely related to that in bone. The centra's lattice parameters 
24	36124628	Temperature independence of haemoglobin-oxygen affinity in smalleye Pacific opah (Lampris incognitus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius).	Smalleye Pacific opah and swordfish can conserve metabolic heat and maintain specific body regions warmer than ambient water temperature (i.e., regional heterothermy). Consequently, blood-O2 uptake at the gills occurs at the environmental temperature at which the individual is found, but O2 offloading will occur at different temperatures in different tissues. While several regionally heterothermic fishes (e.g., billfishes, tunas, and sharks) show a reduced temperature effect on haemoglobin (Hb)-O2 affinity, the temperature-dependence of Hb-O2 affinity in opah and swordfish is unknown. We hypothesized that the Hb of opah and swordfish would also show a reduced temperature-dependence. Opah whole blood-O2 affinity exhibited a reverse temperature-dependence above 50% Hb-O2 saturation (10-20°C, pH 7.2-8.0), while the temperature-dependence of swordfish blood-O2 affinity (10-25°C) was saturation and pH dependent, becoming temperature-independent below 50% Hb-O2 saturation and pH 7.4. Experiments on stripped haemolysates showed that adding ATP ([ATP]/[Hb]=30) decreased the temperature sensitivity of Hb-O2 affinity, changing the overall oxygenation enthalpy (ΔH') values of opah (10-20°C) and swordfish (10-25°C) Hbs at pH 7.4 from -15 and -42 kJ mol-1 O2, respectively, to +84 and -9 kJ mol-1 O2. Swordfish blood-O2 affinity was high compared to other large, pelagic, marine teleosts, which may be due to unusually low ATP/Hb levels, but might also enable swordfish to forage in the potentially low-oxygenated water of the upper reaches of the oxygen minimum layer. The existence of Hbs with reduced temperature sensitivity in regionally heterothermic fishes may prevent marked changes in Hb-O2 affinity between the cold and warm tissues.

Multiple observations that organismal life span can be extended by nutritional, genetic, or pharmacological intervention has raised the prospect of transforming medicine with the goal of slowing, stopping, or even reversing age-associated disease and maintaining or restoring health and resilience in the increasing numbers of elderly across the world. The potential for such an enterprise is supported in theory by plant and animal models of negligible senescence, most notably the small, freshwater organism 
26	36113883	Sharks Provide Evidence for a Highly Complex TNFSF Repertoire in the Jawed Vertebrate Ancestor.	"Cytokines of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF) control many immunological processes and are implicated in the etiology of many immune disorders and diseases. Despite their obvious biological importance, the TNFSF repertoires of many species remain poorly characterized. In this study, we perform detailed bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and syntenic analyses of five cartilaginous fish genomes to identify their TNFSF repertoires. Strikingly, we find that shark genomes harbor ∼30 TNFSF genes, more than any other vertebrate examined to date and substantially more than humans. This is due to better retention of the ancestral jawed vertebrate TNFSF repertoire than any other jawed vertebrate lineage, combined with lineage-specific gene family expansions. All human TNFSFs appear in shark genomes, except for lymphotoxin-α (LTA; TNFSF1) and TNF (TNFSF2), and CD70 (TNFSF7) and 4-1BBL (TNFSF9), which diverged by tandem duplications early in tetrapod and mammalian evolution, respectively. Although lacking one-to-one LTA and TNF orthologs, sharks have evolved lineage-specific clusters of LTA/TNF co-orthologs. Other key findings include the presence of two BAFF (TNFSF13B) genes along with orthologs of APRIL (TNFSF13) and BALM (TNFSF13C) in sharks, and that all cartilaginous fish genomes harbor an ∼400-million-year-old cluster of multiple FASLG (TNFSF6) orthologs. Finally, sharks have retained seven ancestral jawed vertebrate TNFSF genes lost in humans. Taken together, our data indicate that the jawed vertebrate ancestor possessed a much larger and diverse TNFSF repertoire than previously hypothesized and oppose the idea that the cartilaginous fish immune system is ""primitive"" compared with that of mammals."
27	36106014	Huffmanela selachii n. sp. (Nematoda: Trichosomoididae: Huffmanelinae): A new species infecting the skin of the great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran) and the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in the Arabian Gulf, off-shore Saudi Arabia.	From January 2017 - December 2019, 75 out of 850 (8.8 %) great hammerhead sharks from the Arabian Gulf had skin lesions of black irregular discolorations on the ventral surface of the head. The lesions consisted of pencil-like lineations often advancing forward by about 2 mm in back-and-forth looped scribbles often forming a relatively linear bands of about 5-7 cm wide. Similar lesions were also found in the blacktip reef shark from the same area within the same period, and consisted of straight to irregular black lines, extended indiscriminately across the skin of the sharks. Microscopic examination of the skin revealed the presence of dark-brown eggs exhibiting the spindle or ellipsoidal eggs characteristic of

Travel represents a major cost for many animals so there should be selection pressure for it to be efficient - at minimum cost. However, animals sometimes exceed minimum travel costs for reasons that must be correspondingly important.

29	36095997	Selective detection of starch in banana fruit with Raman spectroscopy.	To develop an analytical method for rapid quantification of starch in agricultural produce, we measured the Raman spectra of ripening banana fruit and compared the obtained data to those of standard starch, sugar, and fiber chemical samples. Standard starches exhibited distinctive Raman bands, which were similar to the spectral features in green banana before ripening. Moreover, these banana-derived Raman bands gradually weakened during 10 d of storage. Standard sugars (glucose, sucrose, and fructose) exhibited Raman bands in both solid and liquid states, whereas standard fibers exhibited broad spectra and no such bands. Although the sugar content increased, no sugar bands were observed in the banana fruit even after ripening. A correlation was found between the Raman bands and starch content obtained by chemical analysis. These results demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can selectively provide information regarding starch in banana fruit and be applied as an analytical method for rapid starch quantification.
30	36095770	A taxonomic revision of Northeast Pacific softnose skates (Rajiformes: Arhynchobatidae: Bathyraja Ishiyama).	Softnose skates (Rajiformes: Arhynchobatidae: Bathyraja Ishiyama) are the most diverse skate genus, with 54 species, and are readily distinguishable from other genera in the family by their poorly calcified, flexible rostral cartilages. Six Bathyraja species are considered valid in the eastern North Pacific, including: B. abyssicola, B. aleutica, B. kincaidii, microtrachys, B. spinosissima, and B. trachura. Similar to other skate genera, eastern North Pacific Bathyraja lack a robust species-specific identification, which leads to issues with setting catch limits and creating management plans. This study identifies and formally redescribes the eastern North Pacific softnose skate species based on morphometric and meristic measurements and includes an Alaskan species, Bering Skate, B. interrupta due to its close morphological relationship to B. kincaidii. A lectotype for B. interrupta is designated. Multivariate tests determined that significant differences existed between the study species. Parsimonious phylogenetic trees showed that B kincaidii represents the basal condition, with B. abyssicola and B. aleutica being the most derived species in the study. The formerly synonymized species B. interrupta and B. kincaidii were shown to be separate, as were the previously synonymized species B. microtrachys and B. trachura. Improved Bathyraja species identification will hopefully assist fisheries managers in developing conservation policies easing the impacts of deep-sea fishing expansion.
31	36095597	Revision of the genus Centrophorus (Squaliformes: Centrophoridae): Part 3Redescription of Centrophorus uyato (Rafinesque) with a discussion of its complicated nomenclatural history.	Centrophorus uyato (Rafinesque, 1810) has a complicated nomenclatural history which has led to multiple scientific names being ascribed to this species. In the Mediterranean Sea, and elsewhere in its range, this species was previously referred to as C. granulosus (Bloch Schneider, 1801). The first paper in this revision series clarified that C. granulosus refers to a much larger species of gulper shark which attains at least 1.7 m length and is absent from the Mediterranean Sea. Further complicating the nomenclature of this species is the fact that the original description clearly refers to a Squalus species, and not a Centrophorus species. In this third part of the revision of the genus Centrophorus, this problematic species is redescribed. A detailed synonymy is provided and it is confirmed that C. machiquensis, C. bragancae and C. zeehaani are junior synonyms of this species. To preserve nomenclatural stability within the genus, the name Centrophorus uyato is retained for this species with a neotype from close to the original type locality off Italy being designated. Intraspecific variation within Centrophorus uyato is also discussed, particularly relating to denticle morphology and body morphology.

Female specimens of the newly described mesoparasitic copepod Tripaphylus squidwardi (Sphyriidae), collected from the Australian blackspot shark, Carcharhinus coatesi, off northern Australia were examined histologically. The 'encapsulated' head of the copepod was found in the ventral musculature of the throat of the shark. The head of the copepod was surrounded by a tissue capsule of unknown origin. There were signs of chronic inflammation associated with the infection, although there appeared to be no effect on the health of the shark.
33	36088355	Sharkipedia: a curated open access database of shark and ray life history traits and abundance time-series.	A curated database of shark and ray biological data is increasingly necessary both to support fisheries management and conservation efforts, and to test the generality of hypotheses of vertebrate macroecology and macroevolution. Sharks and rays are one of the most charismatic, evolutionary distinct, and threatened lineages of vertebrates, comprising around 1,250 species. To accelerate shark and ray conservation and science, we developed Sharkipedia as a curated open-source database and research initiative to make all published biological traits and population trends accessible to everyone. Sharkipedia hosts information on 58 life history traits from 274 sources, for 170 species, from 39 families, and 12 orders related to length (n = 9 traits), age (8), growth (12), reproduction (19), demography (5), and allometric relationships (5), as well as 871 population time-series from 202 species. Sharkipedia relies on the backbone taxonomy of the IUCN Red List and the bibliography of Shark-References. Sharkipedia has profound potential to support the rapidly growing data demands of fisheries management, international trade regulation as well as anchoring vertebrate macroecology and macroevolution.
34	36087420	Ontogeny of the inner ear maculae in school sharks (Galeorhinus galeus).	Studies on the auditory system of fishes can provide fundamental information about the early evolution of vertebrate hearing. While there are limited data available on the auditory system of bony fishes, comparatively far less is known about auditory structures in elasmobranchs, despite their critical basal position within vertebrate evolution. Specifically, while there is a high degree of plasticity in the nervous system, little is known about how the different sensory epithelia within the inner ear vary throughout life in elasmobranchs. Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy, we quantified macular area, number of sensory hair cells, hair cell density, and hair cell orientations in the saccule, lagena, utricle, and macula neglecta of school sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) of varying body size. In all maculae, macular area and the number of hair cells increased significantly throughout ontogeny, while hair cell density displayed a concurrent ontogenetic decrease (excluding the utricle). There were also significant differences in macular area, hair cell number, and hair cell density between the four maculae. However, hair cell orientation patterns did not vary between individuals and did not change with body growth. These findings represent one of the first comprehensive characterisations of the inner ear sensory epithelia in an elasmobranch, and reveal changes in morphology that may have implications for auditory capabilities through ontogeny.
35	36086896	Quantifying teleost discards in the shark fisheries of Western Australia.	Quantifying discards is essential for assessing the impact of fisheries on non-target species and the ecosystems in which these fisheries operate. In Western Australia (WA), fishers are required only to report catches of retained species. For the currently operating shark fisheries of WA, the authors quantified catch time series of discarded teleosts using data from at-sea observers collected since 1993. Sixty-two teleost species were observed in the catch of which 20 were routinely discarded. The most commonly discarded teleosts were western buffalo bream/silver drummer, Kyphosus cornelii/K. sydneyanus, and dusky morwong, Dactylophora nigricans. Annual discards peaked in the 1990s; nonetheless, current discard levels, 36.9 ± 2.1 (S.E.) t year
36	36083384	Loss of Myomixer Results in Defective Myoblast Fusion, Impaired Muscle Growth, and Severe Myopathy in Zebrafish.	The development and growth of fish skeletal muscles require myoblast fusion to generate multinucleated myofibers. While zebrafish fast-twitch muscle can fuse to generate multinucleated fibers, the slow-twitch muscle fibers remain mononucleated in zebrafish embryos and larvae. The mechanism underlying the fiber-type-specific control of fusion remains elusive. Recent genetic studies using mice identified a long-sought fusion factor named Myomixer. To understand whether Myomixer is involved in the fiber-type specific fusion, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of myomixer expression and characterized the muscle growth phenotype upon genetic deletion of myomixer in zebrafish. The data revealed that overexpression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) drastically inhibited myomixer expression and blocked myoblast fusion, recapitulating the phenotype upon direct genetic deletion of myomixer from zebrafish. The fusion defect in myomixer mutant embryos could be faithfully rescued upon re-expression of zebrafish myomixer gene or its orthologs from shark or human. Interestingly, myomixer mutant fish survived to adult stage though were notably smaller than wildtype siblings. Severe myopathy accompanied by the uncontrolled adipose infiltration was observed in both fast and slow muscle tissues of adult myomixer mutants. Collectively, our data highlight an indispensable role of myomixer gene for cell fusion during both embryonic muscle development and post-larval muscle growth.

"PURPOSE: The stomachs and spiral valves of sharks and rays were examined for their trypanorhynch (Cestoda) parasite fauna and dietary items to infer feeding ecology. In Indonesia, sharks and rays have been experiencing increasing awareness and conservation in the recent years due to high fisheries activities and to avoid future species extinction.
METHODS: The samples were collected in 2009 from two different sampling sites at the southern coasts of Java and Bali in Indonesia. The parasite fauna was studied for 41 elasmobranch fishes. Amongst these, three shark species, Carcharhinus sorrah, Carcharhinus sp. I and Squalus megalops and seven ray species, Brevitrygon heterura, B. cf. heterura, Gymnura zonura, Maculabatis gerrardi, Mobula kuhlii, Neotrygon cauruleopuncatata and Rhinobatos penggali were studied. Four additional specimens, belonging to the shark species Carcharhinus sp. II and Mustelus cf. manazo and the ray species Maculabatis gerrardi were studied from the waters of South Bali.
RESULTS: Analyses of the feeding ecology of the ray M. gerrardi revealed distinct differences between both sampling sites, indicating the presence of ecological differences between the geographically independent regions. A total of 11 different trypanorhynch species/taxa belonging to the five families Eutetrarhynchidae (5), Gilquiniidae (1), Lacistorhynchidae (1), Pterobothriidae (1) and Tentaculariidae (3) were found. Ten trypanorhynch species from Penyu Bay and four species from South Bali could be identified. Two taxa that might represent new species were collected: Dollfusiella sp. from Brevitrygon heterura and Prochristianella sp. from Maculabatis gerrardi.
CONCLUSIONS: The present paper gives insights in using the trypanorhynch cestode community in combination with feeding ecology analyses to support conservation of elasmobranchs in Indonesian waters."

"Groups of basking sharks engaged in circling behaviour are rarely observed, and their function remains enigmatic in the absence of detailed observations. Here, underwater and aerial video recordings of multiple circling groups of basking sharks during late summer (August and September 2016-2021) in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean showed groups numbering between 6 and 23 non-feeding individuals of both sexes. Sharks swam slowly in a rotating ""torus"" (diameter range: 17-39 m), with individuals layered vertically from the surface to a maximum depth of 16 m. Within a torus, sharks engaged in close-following, echelon, close-flank approach or parallel-swimming behaviours. Measured shark total body lengths were 5.4-9.5 m (mean L"
40	36070183	Female wound records suggest mating periods for the Caribbean reef shark at an insular marine protected area from the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean.	Despite being one of the most abundant, economically significant, reef-associated shark species, little is known about the reproductive aspects of the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In the present study the authors report the first evidence of mating wounds and scars in female Caribbean reef sharks at the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, a remote marine protected area in the South Atlantic Ocean. Data from four females suggest this species mates mainly during the austral summer, between February and March. Given that the archipelago has been previously described as a nursery ground for the Caribbean reef shark, these results add information about the reproductive cycle of this species in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean.
41	36066000	Exploring diet shifts and ecology in modern sharks using calcium isotopes and trace metal records of their teeth.	Sharks occupy all living environments of the marine realm as well as some freshwater systems.

As a potential alternative, we discuss the variability in δ
42	36065963	Psychological and social well-being of bony fishes in zoos and aquariums.	Research on the behavior of animals in zoos has been conducted for decades and observations have provided information that has improved the psychological and social well-being of animals. However, research on fishes in zoos and aquariums seems to be lacking. Here we assess the current state of research on fishes in zoos and aquariums by surveying peer-reviewed literature. Our assessment differs from previous surveys in that we examine the taxonomic classes Chondrichthyes (sharks and rays) and Osteichthyes (bony fishes) separately. Our survey finds that bony fishes have been drastically underrepresented in zoo journals, more so than chondrichthyans, revealing an urgent need for zoos and aquariums to conduct research on the behavior of the bony fishes in their care, to ensure a positive state of psychological and social well-being. To plot a course for the future, we discuss the few studies that have been conducted on the behavior of bony fishes in zoos and aquariums, and we discuss research conducted on bony fishes in food-fish aquaculture and biomedicine to identify the types of studies that could be conducted in zoos and aquariums. We conclude that data-driven analyses of fish behavior could aid in development of evidence-based practices that enhance the well-being of bony fishes in zoos and aquariums, just as they already do for terrestrial animals.
43	36060053	3D visualization processes for recreating and studying organismal form.	The study of biological form is a vital goal of evolutionary biology and functional morphology. We review an emerging set of methods that allow scientists to create and study accurate 3D models of living organisms and animate those models for biomechanical and fluid dynamic analyses. The methods for creating such models include 3D photogrammetry, laser and CT scanning, and 3D software. New multi-camera devices can be used to create accurate 3D models of living animals in the wild and captivity. New websites and virtual reality/augmented reality devices now enable the visualization and sharing of these data. We provide examples of these approaches for animals ranging from large whales to lizards and show applications for several areas: Natural history collections; body condition/scaling, bioinspired robotics, computational fluids dynamics (CFD), machine learning, and education. We provide two datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of CFD and machine learning approaches and conclude with a prospectus.
44	36059247	Histomorphological stratification of blubber of three dolphin species from subtropical waters.	Blubber is a highly specialized and dynamic tissue unique to marine mammals and presents a reflection of the individuals' nutrition, environment, and life history traits. Few studies have investigated the histomorphology of cetacean blubber in subtropical environments. The aim of this study was to investigate the blubber histomorphology of three different dolphin species off the subtropical KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa, using adipocyte cell size, number, and density. Blubber tissue samples from the saddle area of 43 incidentally bycaught animals (four Sousa plumbea, 36 Tursiops aduncus, and three Delphinus delphis) were used to compare cell parameters between blubber layers. Samples were divided into the upper third (corresponding to the superficial layer closest to the epidermis), middle third, and lower third (corresponding to the deep layer). For T. aduncus, factors potentially affecting blubber histomorphology, such as sex, age class, and season, were also assessed. Our results showed that no stratification was present in S. plumbea, which could be ascribed to the species' warmer inshore habitat, large body size, and apparent lower mobility. For T. aduncus and D. capensis, however, blubber stratification was determined, characterized by a gradual transition of cell size, number, and density between layers rather than clearly defined layers. Significant differences in adipocyte cell number and density were found for different sexes and age classes of T. aduncus. However, there were no significant differences between seasons, which was attributed to the small temperature differences between seasons. This study represents the first investigation of odontocete blubber histomorphology in subtropical waters. It is recommended that future studies investigate blubber lipid content, while also taking into consideration the reproductive status of the females and the temperature range of their study area. It is hoped that our results, in conjunction with histopathology and other health indicators, could assist in assessing health and body condition.
45	36059141	Jaw mechanics in macrophagous lamniform sharks and their evolutionary and functional implications.	Jaw mechanics of lamniform sharks were examined three-dimensionally to analyze the variability in jaw shape and the evolution of the jaw system based on the extant macrophagous species. Three-dimensional lever analysis was applied to lamniform jaws to calculate bite force at each tooth relative to maximum input force from jaw adductor muscles for interspecific comparison of efficiency in lamniform jaws. When total input force from the jaw adductor muscles on both working and balancing sides of the skull is considered, input force varies along the jaw because the contribution by balancing side muscles is not constant. The phylogenetically basal-most species, Mitsukurina owstoni, has the least efficient jaws due to posteriorly positioned jaw adductor muscles. Our study shows that the higher efficiency of jaws is regarded as apomorphic in lamniform phylogeny owing to the anterior extension of jaw adductor muscles relative to M. owstoni and a relative decrease in jaw length in relation to width seen in some species, both of which increase leverage. Differences in the efficiency of jaws among derived genera or species are due to the morphology of their jaws. The relationship between calculated bite force relative to maximum input force and tooth morphology indicates low relative bite forces being exerted at anteriorly located, narrow, piercing teeth, whereas high relative bite forces at posteriorly located, broad, cutting, or crushing-type teeth. As a result, the biting pressure during feeding is maintained throughout the tooth series.
46	36056568	A Quantitative Study of Transport of Surfactant Boli in a Three-Dimensional Lung Model of Neonates.	Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is mainly treated with the intratracheal delivery of pulmonary surfactants. The success of the therapy depends on the uniformity of distribution and efficiency of delivery of the instilled surfactant solution to the respiratory zone of the lungs. Direct imaging of the surfactant distribution and quantifying the efficiency of delivery is not feasible in neonates. To address this major limitation, we designed an eight-generation computational model of neonate lung airway tree using morphometric and geometric data of human lungs and fabricated it using additive manufacturing. Using this model, we performed systematic studies of delivery of a clinical surfactant either at a single aliquot or at two aliquots under different orientations of the airway tree in the gravitational space to mimic rolling a neonate on its side during the procedure. Our study offers both a novel lung airway model and new insights into effects of the orientation of the lung airways and presence of a pre-existing surfactant film on how the instilled surfactant solution distributes in airways.
47	36056454	Vertical space use and thermal range of the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), (Rüppell, 1837) in the western North Atlantic.	The great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) is a highly mobile, large-bodied shark primarily found in coastal-pelagic and semi-oceanic waters across a circumtropical range. It is a target or by-catch species in multiple fisheries, and as a result, rapid population declines have occurred in many regions. These declines have contributed to the species being assessed as globally critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. Although conservation and management measures have yielded promising results in some regions, such as the United States, high levels of at-vessel and post-release mortality remain a major concern to the species population recovery. This examined the vertical space use and thermal range of pop-off archival satellite-tagged S. mokarran in the western North Atlantic Ocean, expanding the understanding of the ecological niche of this species and providing insight into by-catch mitigation strategies for fisheries managers. The results showed that S. mokarran predominantly used shallow depths (75% of records <30 m) and had a narrow temperature range (89% of records between 23 and 28°C). Individual differences in depth use were apparent, and a strong diel cycle was observed, with sharks occupying significantly deeper depths during the daytime. Furthermore, two individuals were confirmed pregnant with one migrating from the Bahamas to South Carolina, U.S.A., providing further evidence of regional connectivity and parturition off the U.S. East Coast. The findings suggest that S. mokarran may be vulnerable to incidental capture in the western North Atlantic commercial longline fisheries due to substantial vertical overlap between the species and the gear. The results can be incorporated into conservation and management efforts to develop and/or refine mitigation measures focused on reducing the by-catch and associated mortality of this species, which can ultimately aide S. mokarran population recovery in areas with poor conservation status.
48	36054604	Novel Outcome Analysis Tool for Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulator Sensor Lead Function and Comparison by Incision Type (2 Versus 3).	"OBJECTIVE: No reported outcome measures have been established to evaluate sensor lead function in the hypoglossal nerve stimulator (HNS). This study describes the development of novel functional outcome measures for intraoperative sensor electrode function and compares 2-incision and 3-incision outcomes for HNS.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent HNS between June 2019 and September 2021. Demographic information, intraoperative findings, and immediate postoperative outcomes were recorded. Structured parameters were developed to compare intraoperative waveforms with six outcome measures utilized: waveform syncing, waveform amplitude, sensory current leakage, shark-fin morphology, cardiac artifact, and overall impression. Two sleep surgeons and two sleep medicine specialists compared all waveforms in a blinded fashion and assigned scores on the Likert Scale.
RESULTS: The cohort included 50 three-incision and 50 two-incision patients. Age, gender, average body mass index, comorbidity profiles, and sleep endoscopy findings did not significantly differ between the two groups. No major complications occurred. The interclass-correlation-coefficient was greater than 0.7 for all comparisons (good to very good interrater reliability). There was no difference in waveform amplitude, cardiac artifact, sensory current leakage, or shark-fin morphology between the two groups. Waveform syncing and overall impression were statistically better in the 2-incision cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to define a structured method of HNS sensor electrode outcome measurement and showed consistent measures by surgeons and sleep medicine specialists. This article supports the transition to the 2-incision technique among surgeons for placement of the sensor lead. Consideration should be given to utilizing this novel tool in the clinical/research setting and validating these measures moving forward.

49	36052296	Age group DNA methylation differences in lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris): Implications for future age estimation tools.	Age information is often non-existent for most shark populations due to a lack of measurable physiological and morphological traits that can be used to estimate age. Recently, epigenetic clocks have been found to accurately estimate age for mammals, birds, and fish. However, since these clocks rely, among other things, on the availability of reference genomes, their application is hampered in non-traditional model organisms lacking such molecular resources. The technique known as Methyl-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) has emerged as a valid alternative for studying DNA methylation biomarkers when reference genome information is missing, and large numbers of samples need to be processed. Accordingly, the MSAP technique was used in the present study to characterize global DNA methylation patterns in lemon sharks from three different age groups (juveniles, subadults, and adults). The obtained results reveal that, while MSAP analyses lack enough resolution as a standalone approach to infer age in these organisms, the global DNA methylation patterns observed using this technique displayed significant differences between age groups. Overall, these results confer that DNA methylation does change with age in sharks like what has been seen for other vertebrates and that MSAP could be useful as part of an epigenetics pipeline to infer the broad range of ages found in large samples sizes.

51	36037370	Strategic intergroup alliances increase access to a contested resource in male bottlenose dolphins.	"Efforts to understand human social evolution rely largely on comparisons with nonhuman primates. However, a population of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia, combines a chimpanzee-like fission-fusion grouping pattern, mating system, and life history with the only nonhuman example of strategic multilevel male alliances. Unrelated male dolphins form three alliance levels, or ""orders"", in competition over females: both within-group alliances (i.e., first- and second-order) and between-group alliances (third-order), based on cooperation between two or more second-order alliances against other groups. Both sexes navigate an open society with a continuous mosaic of overlapping home ranges. Here, we use comprehensive association and consortship data to examine fine-scale alliance relationships among 121 adult males. This analysis reveals the largest nonhuman alliance network known, with highly differentiated relationships among individuals. Each male is connected, directly or indirectly, to every other male, including direct connections with adult males outside of their three-level alliance network. We further show that the duration with which males consort females is dependent upon being well connected with third-order allies, independently of the effect of their second-order alliance connections, i.e., alliances between groups increase access to a contested resource, thereby increasing reproductive success. Models of human social evolution traditionally link intergroup alliances to other divergent human traits, such as pair bonds, but our study reveals that intergroup male alliances can arise directly from a chimpanzee-like, promiscuous mating system without one-male units, pair bonds, or male parental care."
52	36017340	Molecular and morphological investigations on the renal mechanisms enabling euryhalinity of red stingray Hemitrygon akajei.	Most cartilaginous fishes live in seawater (SW), but a few exceptional elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) are euryhaline and can acclimate to freshwater (FW) environments. The plasma of elasmobranchs is high in NaCl and urea concentrations, which constrains osmotic water loss. However, these euryhaline elasmobranchs maintain high levels of plasma NaCl and urea even when acclimating to low salinity, resulting in a strong osmotic gradient from external environment to body fluid. The kidney consequently produces a large volume of dilute urine to cope with the water influx. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of dilute urine production in the kidney of Japanese red stingray, 
53	36009714	Assessment of the Impact on 20 Pelagic Fish Species by the Taiwanese Small-Scale Longline Fishery in the Western North Pacific Using Ecological Risk Assessment.	Ecological risk assessment (ERA) has been applied on assessing the relative risk of bycatch species in recent years. ERA index is calculated by productivity of species and susceptibility of fisheries on fish species. In this study, a semi-quantitative method was used to evaluate the risks of exploitation for 20 pelagic fish species by the small-scale longline fisheries in the western North Pacific Ocean. The productivity was estimated based on the ranking (high, median, and low) of seven life history parameters. The susceptibility was calculated by the multiplication of the catchability, selectivity and post-capture mortality. The ERA results indicated the risks of sharks are higher than those of tunas and billfishes, except yellowfin tuna (
54	36004800	Fish tapeworms (Cestoda) in the molecular era: achievements, gaps and prospects.	The tapeworms of fishes (Chondrichthyes and Actinopterygii) account one-third (1670 from around 5000) of the total tapeworm (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda) species diversity. In total 1186 species from 9 orders occur as adults in elasmobranchs (sharks, rays and chimaeras), and 484 species from 8 orders mature in ray-finned fishes (referred to here as teleosts). Teleost tapeworms are dominated by freshwater species (78%), but only 3% of elasmobranch tapeworms are known from freshwater rays of South America and Asia (Borneo). In the last 2 decades, vast progress has been made in understanding species diversity, host associations and interrelationships among fish tapeworms. In total, 172 new species have been described since 2017 (149 from elasmobranchs and 23 from teleosts; invalidly described taxa are not included, especially those from the Oriental region). Molecular data, however, largely limited to a few molecular markers (mainly 28S rDNA, but also 18S and 
55	35994028	Biomechanics of the jaws of spotted ratfish.	Elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays) consume prey of a variety of sizes and properties, and the feeding mechanism typically reflects diet. Spotted ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei (Holocephali, sister group of elasmobranchs), consume both hard and soft prey; however, the morphology of the jaws does not reflect the characteristics typical of durophagous elasmobranchs. This study investigated the mechanical properties and morphological characteristics of the jaws of spotted ratfish over ontogeny, including strain, stiffness and second moment of area, to evaluate the biomechanical function of the feeding structures. Compressive stiffness of the jaws (E=13.51-21.48 MPa) is similar to that of silicone rubber, a very flexible material. In Holocephali, the upper jaw is fused to the cranium; we show that this fusion reduces deformation experienced by the upper jaw during feeding. The lower jaw resists bending primarily in the posterior half of the jaw, which occludes with the region of the upper jaw that is wider and flatter, thus potentially providing an ideal location for the lower jaw to crush or crack prey. The mechanical properties and morphology of the feeding apparatus of spotted ratfish suggest that while the low compressive stiffness is a material limit of the jaw cartilage, spotted ratfish, and perhaps all holocephalans, evolved structural solutions (i.e. fused upper jaw, shape variation along lower jaw) to meet the demands of a durophagous diet.
56	35986014	Increased shark bite survivability revealed by two centuries of Australian records.	The perceived and real threat of shark bites have significant direct health and indirect economic impacts. Here we assess the changing odds of surviving an unprovoked shark bite using 200 years of Australian records. Bite survivability rates for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) and white (Carcharodon carcharias) sharks were assessed relative to environmental and anthropogenic factors. Survivability of unprovoked bull, tiger and white shark bites were 62, 75 and 53% respectively. Bull shark survivability increased over time between 1807 and 2018. Survivability decreased for both tiger and white sharks when the person was doing an in water activity, such as swimming or diving. Not unsurprisingly, a watercraft for protection/floatation increased survivability to 92% from 30%, and 88% from 45%, for tiger and white sharks respectively. We speculate that survival may be related to time between injury and treatment, indicating the importance of rapid and appropriate medical care. Understanding the predictors of unprovoked bites, as well as survivability (year and water activity), may be useful for developing strategies that reduce the number of serious or fatal human-shark interactions without impacting sharks and other marine wildlife.
57	35984887	Diving into the vertical dimension of elasmobranch movement ecology.	Knowledge of the three-dimensional movement patterns of elasmobranchs is vital to understand their ecological roles and exposure to anthropogenic pressures. To date, comparative studies among species at global scales have mostly focused on horizontal movements. Our study addresses the knowledge gap of vertical movements by compiling the first global synthesis of vertical habitat use by elasmobranchs from data obtained by deployment of 989 biotelemetry tags on 38 elasmobranch species. Elasmobranchs displayed high intra- and interspecific variability in vertical movement patterns. Substantial vertical overlap was observed for many epipelagic elasmobranchs, indicating an increased likelihood to display spatial overlap, biologically interact, and share similar risk to anthropogenic threats that vary on a vertical gradient. We highlight the critical next steps toward incorporating vertical movement into global management and monitoring strategies for elasmobranchs, emphasizing the need to address geographic and taxonomic biases in deployments and to concurrently consider both horizontal and vertical movements.

59	35975997	Aquatic Flaviviruses.	Flaviviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, including some well-known human pathogens such as Zika, dengue, and yellow fever viruses, which are primarily associated with mosquito and tick vectors. The vast majority of flavivirus research has focused on terrestrial environments; however, recent findings indicate that a range of flaviviruses are also present in aquatic environments, both marine and freshwater. These flaviviruses are found in various hosts, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms. Although the effects of aquatic flaviviruses on the hosts they infect are not all known, some have been detected in farmed species and may have detrimental effects on the aquaculture industry. Exploration of the evolutionary history through the discovery of the Wenzhou shark flavivirus in both a shark and crab host is of particular interest since the potential dual-host nature of this virus may indicate that the invertebrate-vertebrate relationship seen in other flaviviruses may have a more profound evolutionary root than previously expected. Potential endogenous viral elements and the range of novel aquatic flaviviruses discovered thus shed light on virus origins and evolutionary history and may indicate that, like terrestrial life, the origins of flaviviruses may lie in aquatic environments.
62	35964750	Investigating the effects of microplastic ingestion in Scyliorhinus canicula from the South of Sicily.	Plastic pollution is increasing dramatically worldwide, causing adverse effects on a wide variety of marine organisms at all trophic levels. As predators, sharks play a key role in marine ecosystems and they could especially be threatened by the ingestion of microplastics. This study contributes to expand the existing data on the MPs ingestion by a Mediterranean elasmobranch species, Scyliorhinus canicula, adding new information on the potential impact that this class of contaminants can have on the metabolism of this ecologically relevant species. The present research is aimed: i) to assess if the ingestion of MPs in S. canicula is related to sex, size and depth of catch; ii) to evaluate the effect of MPs on fish body condition; iii) to evaluate if the ingested MPs influence the amino acid and fatty acid composition of eye and liver. A total of 61 specimens of S. canicula were analysed. Forty-nine individuals (80.3 %) had ingested plastic items. Totally, 147 plastic elements were found, mainly belonging to small MPs (49 %), and large MPs (46 %), mostly represented by fibers (84 %). The predominant colour was black. No differences were found between sex and size. A difference in the number of items/specimens related to the deep, highest between 50 and 100 m (4.4), while the lowest between 101 and 500 m (2.1) was found. The condition factor (Kn) value was equal to 1.00 highlighting the wellness of the fish. Arginine (20.1 %), Glutamate (17.4), Phenylalanine (15.7 %), Proline (15.6 %) and were the most abundant amino acids in the eyes of S. canicula. The relative fatty acid composition of the livers was dominated by fatty acids SA (30.2 %) (SFA), CA (29.9 %) (SFA) and OA (22.4 %) (MUFA). This paper reports a study on the relationship between amino acids and fatty acids composition and ingested MPs, highlighting that no significant effects were found.
63	35963405	Size distribution patterns of silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis shaped by environmental factors in the Pacific Ocean.	Commercial fisheries, especially pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and/or swordfish, often land silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Due to increasing fishing effort and the fact that they overlap in habitat with target species, the population trend of silky sharks is declining worldwide. Understanding their relationships with environmental variables that lead to their capture by fisheries is critical for their management and conservation. Nevertheless, little is known about their size distribution in relation to environmental variables in the Pacific Ocean. Using data from the Chinese Observer Tuna Longline fishery from 2010 to 2020, this study developed a species distribution model (SDM) to analyze the relationships between silky shark size distribution patterns and environmental variables and spatio-temporal variability at fishing locations. Observed sizes ranged from 36 to 269 cm fork length (FL). The final model suggests that sea surface temperature (SST), primary production (photosynthetically available radiation, PAR), and ocean surface winds were the key environmental variables shaping size distribution patterns of silky sharks in the Pacific. A high proportion of larger silky sharks has been predicted in areas associated with productive upwelling systems. In addition, the model predicted that larger specimens (>140 cm FL) occur near the equator, and smaller specimens farther from the equator but still in tropical regions. Two regions in the eastern Pacific (the coastal upwelling area off northern Peru and the waters around the Galapagos Islands) seem to be important locations for larger specimens. The size distribution patterns of silky sharks in relation to environmental variables presented in this study illustrate how this species segregates spatially and temporally and presents potential habitat preference areas. The information obtained in the present study is critical in the quest for management and conservation of menaced species such as the silky shark.
64	35963222	Heavy metal concentrations in the Pacific sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon longurio from the Santa Rosalia mining zone, Baja California Sur, Mexico.	Rhizoprionodon longurio is an important commercial species captured in an area with heavy metal presence due to the mining waste from Santa Rosalia, Gulf of California, and levels of heavy metals in its muscle remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether contamination levels are below the limits allowed for human consumption and to prevent health damage. Concentrations of essential (Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) and non-essential (Ag, Cd, and Pb) trace elements were determined in fifty-seven muscle samples of R. longurio. The average concentrations of Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > Cd > Ag did not exceed the permissible limits for human consumption established by the Mexican norm, WHO, and FAO. The mineral daily ingestion was 0.10 to 0.53 % × 100 g of muscle, and the percentage of weekly consumption was 2.5 % to <12 % concerning corporal weight.

The Pacific coast of Colombia is characterized by mangrove ecosystems which play a crucial role as possible nurseries for juvenile sharks. However, trophic food webs from coastal ecosystems are heavily disturbed by increased fishing pressure, which affects numerous shark species. In this region of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), fisheries' data from coastal areas are scarce and unspecific, as most sharks from artisanal fisheries are landed decapitated and finless, making their morphological identification difficult. For the establishment and implementation of effective regional conservation and management policies, information on the diversity and population dynamics of shark species is crucial. We therefore sequenced the mitochondrial NADH2 gene of 696 samples taken from fishermen's landings of shark's bycatch along the Colombian north Pacific coast. We were able to identify 14 species of sharks, two of the most abundant species were

A global movement towards decreases in elasmobranch overfishing has been noted in the last decades. However, discussion concerning the effects of POP contamination on the health and survival of these organisms is still recent. These compounds can affect the immune and endocrine systems of both sharks and batoids, impairing reproduction and impacting species recruitment, acting synergistically alongside overfishing effects. In this context, this study investigated the concentration of organochlorine compounds in liver of 29 individuals of Rioraja agassizii, a commercially exploited skate classified as Vulnerable by IUCN and as Endangered in Brazil. Contaminant concentrations were higher in adults compared to juveniles. Distinct contamination profiles were observed, suggesting different groups within the investigated population and revealing contaminants as a potential tool to assess population ecology. PCB levels were considered a concern as they resemble concentrations in ecosystems from the northern hemisphere, where deleterious effects on elasmobranchs have been observed.
69	35932999	An ancient alliance: Matching evolutionary patterns of cartilaginous fishes (Elasmobranchii) and chloromyxid parasites (Myxozoa).	Myxozoa is a group of endoparasitic cnidarians covering almost 2600 species but merely 53 species, mostly from the genus Chloromyxum, have been reported from sharks, rays, and skates (Elasmobranchii). Elasmobranchs play a key role in the study of evolutionary trajectories of myxozoans as they represent ancestral vertebrate hosts. Our study provides new data on Chloromyxum spp. from 57 elasmobranchs, covering 20 species from geographical regions and host groups not previously investigated, such as Lamniformes and Hexanchiformes, the most basal phylogenetic shark lineage. In total, 28% of elasmobranchs were infected with Chloromyxum spp., indicating high diversity. Of the seven distinguished species, six are formally described based on morphological, morphometric, and genetic (18S rDNA) data. Comprehensive co-phylogenetic analyses and ancestral state reconstruction revealed that parasite and host phylogenies are clearly correlated, resulting in a distinct phylogenetic separation of chloromyxids from selachid (shark) vs. batoid (ray and skate) hosts. Species infecting the most ancient elasmobranchs formed a sublineage, branching off in the middle of the Chloromyxum sensu stricto clade. Our findings indicate that chloromyxids likely invaded an ancestral elasmobranch prior the time of divergence of shark and batoid lineages. Our analyses did not show a clear phylogeographic pattern of Chloromyxum parasites, probably due to the cosmopolitan distribution and migratory behaviour of many elasmobranch hosts, but geographical sampling must be extended to confirm or refute this observation. This study provides a complex view on species diversity, phylogeny, evolution, host-parasite co-phylogeny, and the phylogeographic origin of Chloromyxum species from elasmobranchs. Our results highlight the importance of adding missing data from previously un- or undersampled geographical regions and host species which results in a more accurate estimate of myxozoan biodiversity and a better understanding of the evolution of this parasite group in their hosts and in the different oceans of our planet.
70	35932509	The impact of climate change on the distribution of Sphyrna lewini in the tropical eastern Pacific.	Variability and climate change due to anthropic influence have brought about alterations to marine ecosystems, that, in turn, have affected the physiology and metabolism of ectotherm species, such as the common hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini). However, the impact that climate variability may have on this species' distribution, particularly in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, which is considered an area with great marine biodiversity, is unknown. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of derivate impact of climate change on the oceanographic distribution of the hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, contrasting the present and future scenarios for 2050. The methodology used was an ecological niche model based on the KUENM R package software that uses the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The modelling was made for the year 2050 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. A total of 952 models were made, out of which only one met the statistical parameters established as optimal, for future scenarios. The environmental suitability for S.lewini shows that this species would migrate to the south in the Chilean Pacific, associated with a possible warming that the equatorial zone will have and the possible cooling that the subtropical zone of the South Pacific will have by 2050, the product of changes in oceanographic dynamics.
71	35929272	Marine origin biomaterials using a compressive and absorption methodology as cell-laden hydrogel envisaging cartilage tissue engineering.	In the recent decade, marine origin products have been growingly studied as building blocks complying with the constant demand of the biomedical sector regarding the development of new devices for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (TERM). In this work, several combinations of marine collagen-chitosan-fucoidan hydrogel were formed using a newly developed eco-friendly compressive and absorption methodology to produce hydrogels (CAMPH), which consists of compacting the biopolymers solution while removing the excess of water. The hydrogel formulations were prepared by blending solutions of 5% collagen from jellyfish and/or 3% collagen from blue shark skin, with solutions of 3% chitosan from squid pens and solutions of 10% fucoidan from brown algae, at different ratios. The biopolymer physico-chemical characterization comprised Amino Acid analysis, ATR-FTIR, CD, SDS-PAGE, ICP, XRD, and the results suggested the shark/jellyfish collagen(s) conserved the triple helical structure and had similarities with type I and type II collagen, respectively. The studied collagens also contain a denaturation temperature of around 30-32 °C and a molecular weight between 120 and 125 kDa. Additionally, the hydrogel properties were determined by rheology, water uptake ability, degradation rate, and SEM, and the results showed that all formulations had interesting mechanical (strong viscoelastic character) and structural stability properties, with a significant positive highlight in the formulation of H

"Background: Different fixation techniques are established for first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) arthrodesis, including compression screws, plates, Kirschner wires, metal- and bioabsorbable screws as well as staples. The purpose of this study was to investigate and present first clinical and radiologic results using a novel human, allogeneic cortical bone screw for arthrodesis of the first MTPJ.
Methods: Arthrodesis of the first MTPJ was performed in 31 patients with hallux rigidus. Percentage union and time to union were the first outcomes; visual analog scale for pain, hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle, and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux score were secondary outcomes.
Results: Median time to union was 89 days, and union was observed in all patients. There were 4 complications (2 osteolysis margin, 1 cystic brightening, and 1 severe swelling at the first follow-up) all of that resolved at last follow-up. Pain significantly decreased from visual analog scale 8.0 to 0.2 points (
Conclusion: Primary and revision arthrodesis of hallux rigidus with the human, allogeneic cortical bone screw reveals satisfying results similar to clinical and radiologic outcomes of other surgical techniques. Within 1 year, the human, allogeneic cortical bone screw is fully remodeled to host bone.
Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case series without control group."
73	35913912	Cloning of nine glucocorticoid receptor isoforms from the slender African lungfish (Protopterus dolloi).	We wanted to clone the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from slender African lungfish (Protopterus dolloi) for comparison to the P. dolloi mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which we had cloned and were characterizing, as well as for comparison to the GRs from humans, elephant shark and zebrafish. However, although sequencing of the genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), as well as, that of the West African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) were reported in the first three months of 2021, we could not retrieve a GR sequence with a BLAST search of GenBank, when we submitted our research for publication in July 2021. Moreover, we were unsuccessful in cloning the GR from slender African lungfish using a cDNA from the ovary of P. dolloi and PCR primers that had successfully cloned a GR from elephant shark, Xenopus and gar GRs. On October 21, 2021 the nucleotide sequence of West African lungfish (P. annectens) GR was deposited in GenBank. We used this GR sequence to construct PCR primers that successfully cloned the GR from the slender spotted lungfish. Here, we report the sequences of nine P. dolloi GR isoforms and explain the basis for the previous failure to clone a GR from slender African lungfish using PCR primers that cloned the GR from elephant shark, Xenopus and gar. Studies are underway to determine corticosteroid activation of these slender African lungfish GRs.
74	35912616	Cellulose-Based Cryogel Microspheres with Nanoporous and Controllable Wrinkled Morphologies for Rapid Hemostasis.	First-aid hemostatic agents for acute bleeding can save lives in emergency situations. However, rapid hemostasis remains challenging when uncontrolled hemorrhage occurs on lethal noncompressible and irregular wounds. Herein, cellulose-based cryogel microspheres with deliberately customized micromorphologies for ultrafast water transportation and diffusion, including the shark skin riblet-inspired wrinkled surface with low fluid drag and the hydrophilic nanoporous 3D networks, are developed to deal with the acute noncompressible bleeding within seconds. These cryogel microspheres can rapidly absorb a large amount of blood over 6 times their own weight in 10 s and form a robust barrier to seal a bleeding wound without applying pressure. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a cardiac penetrating hole is effectively stopped using the microspheres within 20 s and no blood leakage is observed after 30 min. Additionally, these microspheres could be readily removed without rebleeding and capillary thrombus, which is highly favorable to rapid hemostasis in emergency rescue.
75	35904249	Optimization technology and kinetic studies of Acer truncatum seed oil saponification and crystallization separation of nervonic acid.	Acer truncatum seed oil (ATSO) contains abundant unsaturated fatty acids, with significant quantities of nervonic acid (NA, > 5%), which was authenticated as a new food resource in China. For the sake of minimizing animal consumption and the importance of NA for human health, extraction of NA from plants has become a research hotspot. In the present study, three extraction factors were determined to significantly influence the saponification reaction based on single-factor experiments: NaOH dosage, reaction time, and reaction temperature. These three factors were used to further optimize the saponification process through the response surface methodology, and the highest yield of mixed fatty acids was 83.12%. Moreover, the activation energy (40.8228 kJ/mol), the pre-exponential factor [2.568 × 10
76	35902605	The microbial carbonate factory of Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia.	Microbialites and peloids are commonly associated throughout the geologic record. Proterozoic carbonate megafacies are composed predominantly of micritic and peloidal limestones often interbedded with stromatolitic textures. The association is also common throughout carbonate ramps and platforms during the Phanerozoic. Recent investigations reveal that Hamelin Pool, located in Shark Bay, Western Australia, is a microbial carbonate factory that provides a modern analog for the microbialite-micritic sediment facies associations that are so prevalent in the geologic record. Hamelin Pool contains the largest known living marine stromatolite system in the world. Although best known for the constructive microbial processes that lead to formation of these stromatolites, our comprehensive mapping has revealed that erosion and degradation of weakly lithified microbial mats in Hamelin Pool leads to the extensive production and accumulation of sand-sized micritic grains.

77	35901124	Nearshore marine biodiversity of Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica: Where the ocean meets the rainforest.	Osa Peninsula in remote southwest Costa Rica harbors 2.5% of global terrestrial biodiversity in only 1,200 km2 and has the largest remaining tract of Pacific lowland wet forest in Mesoamerica. However, little is known about the marine ecosystems of this diverse region. Much of the coastline consists of soft sediment exposed to strong wave action. Three major hard bottom habitat types define this region, including: 1) coral reefs around Isla del Caño Biological Reserve, a no-take marine protected area (MPA) of 52 km2, 2) coastal rocky reefs and islets along the peninsula, including Corcovado National Park, and 3) submerged pinnacles just outside the Isla del Caño MPA. Average coral cover at Isla del Caño was 21%, composed primarily of Porites lobata and Pocillopora elegans. In contrast, coastal rocky reefs were dominated by turf algae (39.8%) and macroalgae (20.7%) with low coral cover (1.1%). Submerged pinnacles were dominated by crustose coralline algae (33.3%) and erect coralline algae (25.7%). Fish assemblage characteristics (species richness, abundance, biomass) were significantly higher at the pinnacles compared to the other habitats and was dominated by schooling species such as Haemulon steindachneri, and the herbivores Kyphosus ocyurus, and Acanthurus xanthopterus. Top predators, primarily Triaenodon obesus, Caranx sexfasciatus, and Lutjanus argentimaculatus, were also most abundant at these pinnacles and accounted for the largest differences in fish trophic structure among habitats. Despite Isla del Caño being fully protected from fishing, biomass was similar to fished areas along the coast and lower than the adjacent submerged pinnacles outside the reserve. Similarly, Corcovado National Park includes 20.3 km2 of no-take MPAs; however, there is limited enforcement, and we noted several instances of fishing within the park. The unique configuration of healthy offshore coral reefs and pinnacles connected to coastal habitats provides corridors for many species including large predators such as sharks and other marine megafauna, which warrants additional protection.

Long-axis rotation (LAR) of the jaws may be an important component of vertebrate feeding mechanisms, as it has been hypothesized to occur during prey capture or food processing across diverse vertebrate groups including mammals, ray-finned fishes, and sharks and rays. LAR can affect tooth orientation as well as muscle fiber direction and therefore muscle power during feeding. However, to date only a handful of studies have demonstrated this LAR in vivo. Here, we use XROMM to document LAR of the upper and lower jaws in white-spotted bamboo sharks,

80	35896482	Aquatic Walking and Swimming Kinematics of Neonate and Juvenile Epaulette Sharks.	The epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, is a small, reef-dwelling, benthic shark that-using its paired fins-can walk, both in and out of water. Within the reef flats, this species experiences short periods of elevated CO2 and hypoxia as well as fluctuating temperatures as reef flats become isolated with the outgoing tide. Past studies have shown that this species is robust (i.e., respiratory and metabolic performance, behaviour) to climate change relevant elevated CO2 levels as well as to be hypoxia and anoxia tolerant. However, epaulette shark embryos reared under ocean warming conditions hatch earlier, smaller, with altered patterns and colouration, and with higher metabolic costs than their current-day counterparts. Findings to date suggest that this species has adaptations to tolerate some, but perhaps not all, of the challenging conditions predicted for the 21st century. As such, the epaulette shark is emerging as a model system to understand vertebrate physiology in changing oceans. Yet, few studies have investigated the kinematics of walking and swimming, which may be vital to their biological fitness, considering their habitat and propensity for challenging environmental conditions. Given that neonates retain embryonic nutrition via an internalized yolk sac, resulting in a bulbous abdomen, while juveniles actively forage for worms, crustaceans, and small fishes, we hypothesized that difference in body shape over early ontogeny would affect locomotor performance. To test this, we examined neonate and juvenile locomotor kinematics during the three aquatic gaits they utilize-slow-to-medium walking, fast-walking, and swimming-using 13 anatomical landmarks along the fins, girdles, and body midline. We found that differences in body shape did not alter kinematics between neonates and juveniles. Overall velocity, fin rotation, axial bending, and tail beat frequency and amplitude were consistent between early life stages. Data suggest that the locomotor kinematics are maintained between neonate and juvenile epaulette sharks, even as their feeding strategy changes. Studying epaulette shark locomotion allows us to understand this-and perhaps related-species' ability to move within and away from challenging conditions in their habitats. Such locomotor traits may not only be key to survival, in general, as a small, benthic mesopredator (i.e., movements required to maneuver into small reef crevices to avoid aerial and aquatic predators) but also may be related to their sustained physiological performance under challenging environmental conditions, including those associated with climate change-a topic worthy of future investigation.
81	35894302	Mercury concentrations in coastal Elasmobranchs (Hypanus guttatus and Rhizoprionodon porosus) and human exposure in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil.	Elasmobranchs are long-lived predatory fish that show high Hg concentrations generally reflecting environmental levels, notwithstanding they are widely consumed in Brazil increasing Hg exposure to humans. This study reports on Hg concentrations in largely consumed sharks (Rhizoprionodon porosus) and rays (Hypanus guttatus) from the Pernambuco coast, NE Brazil and the risk associated with their consumption. Muscle tissue concentrations of Hg in H. guttatus and R. porosus varied from 40 to 1,020 ng.g-1 w.w. (median = 125; mean = 124 ± 48 ng.g-1 w.w.) in sharks and from 129 to 2,130 ng.g-1 w.w. (median = 976; mean = 919 ± 139 ng.g-1 w.w.) in rays. Concentrations of Hg positively correlated with size in sharks, but not in rays. Concentrations reflect the local environmental contamination of a large urban center and industrial park concentrated in a short extension of mangrove-dominated coastline (50 km) and are higher compared to other Brazilian sites where Hg concentrations in these species have been reported. Sharks had a risk coefficient (HQ) range of 0.04 to 1.1, not surpassing the reference level of exposure. On the other hand, rays' HQ ranged from 0.14 to 2.3, and exceeds the reference level of exposure and suggests adverse effects to consumers.
82	35890231	A Single Domain Shark Antibody Targeting the Transferrin Receptor 1 Delivers a TrkB Agonist Antibody to the Brain and Provides Full Neuroprotection in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.	Single domain shark antibodies that bind to the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) on brain endothelial cells have been used to shuttle antibodies and other cargos across the blood brain barrier (BBB) to the brain. For these studies the TXB4 brain shuttle was fused to a TrkB neurotrophin receptor agonist antibody. The TXB4-TrkB fusion retained potent agonist activity at its cognate receptor and after systemic administration showed a 12-fold increase in brain levels over the unmodified antibody. Only the TXB4-TrkB antibody fusion was detected within the brain and localized to TrkB positive cells in the cortex and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where it was associated with activated ERK1/2 signaling. When tested in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), TXB4-TrkB, but not the unmodified antibody, completely prevented the 6-OHDA induced death of TH positive neurons in the SNc. In conclusion, the fusion of the TXB4 brain shuttle allows a TrkB agonist antibody to reach neuroprotective concentrations in the brain parenchyma following systemic administration.

"ABSTRACT: Fish maws (dried swim bladders) have long been used for medicinal tonics and as a valuable food resource in Southeast Asia. However, it is difficult to identify the original species of fish maws sold in markets due to a lack of taxonomic characteristics. In the present study, 37 kinds of commercial fish maws from various medicinal material markets were examined, and gene sequences were successfully obtained from ca. 95% of the samples. Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene were obtained and used to investigate the origin of these commercial fish maws. Thirty-five specimens belonged to nine species: five croakers and four noncroakers. All species identification was supported by both high homogeneity (98 to 100%) and clear clustering with low within-group Kimura two-parameter divergence scores (0 to 0.04 for 16S rRNA and 0 to 0.07 for COI) and high between-group divergence scores (0.07 to 0.15 for 16S rRNA and 0.11 to 0.24 for COI). Croakers were the predominant species, accounting for 74% of the total fish maw specimens. The large demand for croakers has put some species at the risk of extinction due to overfishing. As a valuable food, fish maw has progressively become more popular and has been used as a substitute for shark fin. The identification results allowed us to learn more about the fish species available on the fish maw market and provided an indicator for possible control of threatened or endangered fish species. A probable correlation between the molecular characteristics and morphological features of fish maws was also found and could provide both consumers and merchants with an important reference for identifying the origin of fish maws.

85	35876771	Tissue-specific transcriptome profiles identify functional differences key to understanding whole plant response to life in variable salinity.	Plants endure environmental stressors via adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. Studying these mechanisms in seagrasses is extremely relevant as they are important primary producers and functionally significant carbon sinks. These mechanisms are not well understood at the tissue level in seagrasses. Using RNA-seq, we generated transcriptome sequences from tissue of leaf, basal leaf meristem and root organs of Posidonia australis, establishing baseline in situ transcriptomic profiles for tissues across a salinity gradient. Samples were collected from four P. australis meadows growing in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Analysis of gene expression showed significant differences between tissue types, with more variation among leaves than meristem or roots. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed the differences were largely due to the role of photosynthesis, plant growth and nutrient absorption in leaf, meristem and root organs, respectively. Differential gene expression of leaf and meristem showed upregulation of salinity regulation processes in higher salinity meadows. Our study highlights the importance of considering leaf meristem tissue when evaluating whole-plant responses to environmental change. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
86	35873368	Diversity, palaeoecology and palaeoenvironmental significance of the Eocene chondrichthyan assemblages of the Bolca Lagerstätte, Italy.	Over the last few years, the morphology, taxonomy and systematics of the cartilaginous fish taxa of the two main sites of the Bolca Lagerstätte, Italy, (Pesciara and Monte Postale sites) have been extensively discussed in a series of papers, resulting in a complete revision of this neglected component of the Eocene Tethyan ichthyofauna. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the diversity, palaeoecology and palaeoenvironmental significance of the two chondrichthyan assemblages of the Pesciara and Monte Postale sites. The assemblages include 14 shark species (Lamniformes and Carcharhiniformes) and batoids (Torpediniformes, Rhinopristiformes, Myliobatiformes, Platyrhinidae and Zanobatidae), as well as a single putative chimaeriform. The Pesciara and Monte Postale sites are characterized by eight chondrichthyan taxa each, but the taxonomic compositions are distinctly different reflecting the dissimilarities in the overall composition of both fish assemblages. Palaeoecological interpretations and habitat preferences of the two chondrichthyan assemblages are consistent with previously hypothesized palaeoenvironmental settings based on sedimentological, palaeontological and geochemical evidence. The chondrichthyan assemblages of the two sites appear to be constituted by ecologically vicariant taxa, with both characterized by a predominance of benthic species with durophagous/cancritrophic feeding modes. Taxonomic composition, habitat preferences and palaeobathymetric analyses support the hypothesis that both assemblages occupied tropical marine shallow waters (likely up to 50 m deep) of the inner portion of the Lessini Shelf. The taxonomic composition of both sites is considerably different from that of any other contemporaneous Tethyan and Boreal chondrichthyan assemblages.
87	35860459	Microstructure of the Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo) Olfactory Rosette.	"Synopsis: The unusual shape of sphyrnid (hammerhead shark) heads has led to many functional hypotheses of potential sensory advantages and enhanced olfactory performance. Recent investigations into the flow of water within the sphyrnid olfactory chamber demonstrate that this complex structure exhibits a differential pressure system between the 2 nares that induces flow through the chamber. This leads to differential fluid velocities in different parts of the olfactory chamber. Particularly, lamellae at the medial end of the olfactory chamber experience a near-stagnant recirculation of water. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the microstructure of the olfactory rosette of bonnethead sharks (
Spanish: La forma inusual de las cabezas de los esfírnidos (tiburones martillo) ha llevado a muchas hipótesis funcionales de posibles ventajas sensoriales y unas mejores capacidades olfativas. Las investigaciones recientes sobre el flujo de agua dentro del órgano olfativo de los esfírnidos, demuestran que esta estructura compleja exhibe un sistema de presión diferente entre las dos fosas nasales que induce el flujo en el órgano. Esto conduce a velocidades de fluido diferentes en distintas partes del órgano olfativo. En particular, las láminas en el extremo medial del órgano olfativo experimentan una recirculación de agua casi estancada. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron 1) describir la microestructura de la roseta olfativa de los tiburones cabeza de pala (Sphyrna tiburo) y 2) considerando la variabilidad del flujo de agua dentro de la roseta olfativa de los esfírnidos, investigar las diferencias de las laminillas individuales, basadas en su posición dentro de la roseta. Específicamente, hemos investigado el grado de plegamiento secundario, el porcentaje del área sensorial y el área relativa de superficie a lo largo del gradiente de lateral a medial. El grado de plegamiento secundario y el porcentaje del área sensorial pueden servir como indicadores de la sensibilidad olfativa, proporcionando conectividad entre el área dedicada a la sensibilidad y el flujo de agua dentro del órgano olfativo. Descubrimos que los tiburones cabeza de pala exhibían una morfología laminar similar a la de otras especies de tiburones. También hemos descrito la proyección del estrato del nervio olfativo dentro de una lámina individual. Además, encontramos que las laminillas dentro de la porción medial del órgano que experimentan velocidades de agua más lentas, tenían menos pliegues laminares secundarios y una menor área sensorial. Estos hallazgos implican que estas áreas pueden ser menos sensitivas. El trabajo futuro debería evaluar las diferencias de sensibilidad dentro de la roseta a lo largo del gradiente de lateral a medial.

88	35852891	The world's largest omnivore is a fish.	The evolution of very large body size requires a ubiquitous and abundant source of food. In marine environments, the largest animals such as whale sharks are secondary consumers that filter feed on nekton, which is plentiful, although patchy. Consequently, feeding in coastal environments requires cost-efficient foraging that focuses on oceanographic features that aggregate both nektonic prey and marine debris such as floating macroalgae. Consumption of this algae could present an energetic challenge for these animals, unless some component can be digested. Here, we use a multi-technique approach involving amino acid compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) and fatty acid analysis to determine the trophic level of whale sharks and to identify likely items in the diet. CSIA analyses showed that the species has a trophic level consistent with omnivory. Fatty acid profiles of whale shark tissues, feces and potential prey items suggest that the floating macroalgae, Sargassum, and its associated epibionts is a significant source of food. Although this overcomes the energetic challenge of consumption of floating algae, this mode of feeding and the need to focus on oceanographic features that aggregate prey also increases the threat to the species posed by pollutants such as plastic.

The animacy effect, the finding that animate items are better remembered than inanimate items, provides evidence that human memory prioritizes information that is related to survival.

90	35848707	Ontogenetic changes in the tooth morphology of bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas).	Teeth are an integral component of feeding ecology, with a clear link between tooth morphology and diet, as without suitable dentition prey cannot be captured nor broken down for consumption. Bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, undergo an ontogenetic niche shift from freshwater to marine habitats, which raises the question: does tooth morphology change with ontogeny? Tooth shape, surface area and thickness were measured using both morphometrics and elliptic Fourier analysis to determine if morphology varied with position in the jaw and if there was an ontogenetic change concordant with this niche shift. Significant ontogenetic differences in tooth morphology as a function of position in the jaw and shark total length were found, with upper and lower jaws of bull sharks presenting two different tooth morphologies. Tooth shape and thickness fell into two groupings, anterior and posterior, in both the upper and lower jaws. Tooth surface area, however, indicated three groupings, mesial, intermediate and distal, in both the upper and lower jaws. While tooth morphology changed significantly with size, showing an inflection at sharks of 135 cm total length, each morphological aspect retained the same tooth groupings throughout. These ontogenetic differences in tooth morphologies reflect tooth strength, prey handling and heterodonty.

In this work contents of PCBs, PCDD/Fs and PBDEs were studied by means of GC-HRMS in muscle and liver of sixty blue sharks from the North East Atlantic sampled in 2019. Concentrations relatively similar were found for PCBs and PCDD/Fs in comparison with those in Atlantic specimens from the same area sampled in 2015. In contrast, PBDE loads doubled, likely mirroring the increased environmental presence of these pollutants. This, together with the different congener profiles reported for the same species in other geographical areas, highlighted the blue shark's potential as bioindicator of the degree and fingerprints of regional pollution by POPs. Interesting dissimilarities between muscle and liver concentrations were detected, most likely ascribed to distinct toxicokinetics involved for the different pollutants. Whereas most POPs preferentially accumulated in liver, some did the opposite in muscle. BDE-209 was the most prominent example, being almost negligible its presence in liver (0.3%) while accounting for ca. 14% of the total PBDE content in muscle. Different findings in this regard described for other shark species call for focused research to ascertain the role of the species in this apparent favored metabolization of BDE-209 in the liver. From a consumption perspective, the concentrations found in muscle -the most relevant part in the human diet-for PCBs and dioxin-like POPs were below the EU maximum allowed levels in foodstuff. Conversely, in liver about 58% and 78% of samples overpassed the European levels for tolerable intake of i-PCBs and dioxin POPs, respectively. Concentrations of PBDEs exceeded EQS (0.0085 ng/g w.w.) established by the European Water Framework Directive in 100% and 92% of liver and muscle samples, respectively, which adds to the open debate of such as a reduce value for this current EQS.
94	35839646	Conservation benefits of a marine protected area on South African chondrichthyans.	Chondrichthyans are threatened worldwide due to their life-history traits combined with a plethora of anthropogenic impacts that are causing populations to collapse. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a conservation option, but their efficacy for chondrichthyans is still unclear. Conservation efforts might be challenging especially in developing countries, due to a lack of resources and monitoring and limited data and stakeholder support. Here Baited Remote Underwater Stereo-Video systems (stereo-BRUVs) were deployed inside and outside a small partially protected MPA (Robberg MPA, Western Cape, South Africa) to assess the status of cartilaginous fishes' assemblages and to investigate the potential benefits derived from the presence of a marine reserve. Overall, 19 chondrichthyan species in 11 different families were observed. Chondrichthyans were observed in 78.5% of the sites and, of these, 89.7% of the MPA sites showed at least one chondrichthyan, while only in the 67.5% of surrounding exploited sites a cartilaginous fish was sighted. The presence of the MPA had a significant effect on the relative abundance of batoids, threatened species and local endemics, with more observations inside the MPA than outside, indicating the potential benefit of marine reserves on species that are more vulnerable to fishing pressure. Relative abundance was generally higher inside the bay than in the exposed area, and both relative abundance and species richness decreased significantly with depth. The analysis of the body length showed that the 35.5% of species had an average body length below maturity length, indicating that the area might be used as nursery ground for different species. This study provides evidence that MPAs, even though small and partially protected, can provide benefits for chondrichthyans, specifically to threatened species, endemic species and lesser-known species. Importantly, different environmental parameters must be considered to maximize the benefits an MPA can provide.
95	35838789	Osmorespiratory compromise in an elasmobranch: oxygen consumption, ventilation and nitrogen metabolism during recovery from exhaustive exercise in dogfish sharks (Squalus suckleyi).	The functional trade-off between respiratory gas exchange versus osmolyte and water balance that occurs at the thin, highly vascularized gills of fishes has been termed the osmorespiratory compromise. Increases in gas exchange capacity for meeting elevated oxygen demands can end up favoring the passive movement of osmolytes and water, potentially causing a disturbance in osmotic balance. This phenomenon has been studied only sparsely in marine elasmobranchs. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of exhaustive exercise (as a modulator of oxygen demand) on oxygen consumption (MO

"The silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis is a large pelagic species distributed in the global oceans and was recently listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the IUCN because of its decline in population due to overfishing. As an apex predator, the silky shark can accumulate elevated quantities of mercury (Hg), posing a potential risk to its remaining population. In this study, total Hg (THg) concentrations were determined in silky shark muscle, liver, dermis, red blood cells (RBC) and plasma sampled from the eastern tropical Pacific, and δ"
97	35822624	Diel Rhythm and Thermal Independence of Metabolic Rate in a Benthic Shark.	Biological rhythms that are mediated by exogenous factors, such as light and temperature, drive the physiology of organisms and affect processes ranging from cellular to population levels. For elasmobranchs (i.e. sharks, rays, and skates), studies documenting diel activity and movement patterns indicate that many species are crepuscular or nocturnal in nature. However, few studies have investigated the rhythmicity of elasmobranch physiology to understand the mechanisms underpinning these distinct patterns. Here, we assess diel patterns of metabolic rates in a small meso-predator, the epaulette shark (
98	35820643	The gut microbiome may influence post-prandial nitrogen handling in an elasmobranch, the Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi).	Nitrogen recycling through the gut microbiome is an important mechanism used throughout vertebrates to reclaim valuable nitrogen trapped in urea. Evidence suggests it may be especially important in nitrogen limited animals, yet little is known about its role in marine elasmobranchs, which are said to be severely nitrogen limited. In the present study we used antibiotics to deplete the gut microbiome of Pacific spiny dogfish and assessed the role of the microbiome in nitrogen handling in both fed and fasted states. In fed animals, antibiotic treatment eliminated the activity of the microbial enzyme urease and reduced cellulase activity by 78%. This reduction in microbial enzyme activity resulted in significantly lower plasma urea levels which then trended upward as urea excretion rates decreased. Ammonia excretion rates were also significantly lower in antibiotic treated fish compared to the control fed. Finally, antibiotic treated fed individuals lost an average of 7.4% of their body mass while the fed controls lost only 1.8% of their body mass. Nitrogen handling in fasted animals was not significantly impacted by a reduction in microbial activity. These results suggest that compromising the gut microbiome significantly influences post-prandial nitrogen handling in spiny dogfish, and that the recycling of urea‑nitrogen may be vital to maintaining nitrogen balance in these fish.

In November 2021, a female bigeye thresher shark was incidentally caught by a pelagic drifting longline off southern Cyprus, corresponding to the second documented species record at country level. Main biological features and an extended list of morphometric measurements are presented in comparison with the previous species records in the Mediterranean. The diet analysis highlighted the impact of marine species invasion in the Mediterranean food webs and documented the presence of the angel squid in Cypriot waters for the first time. The species presence in the basin is revised and discussed.
100	35817163	Trophic niche partitioning of five sympatric shark species in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean revealed by multi-tissue fatty acid analysis.	Fatty acid (FA) analysis of consumer tissues has recently shown utility in drawing further inferences about trophic niche dynamics of marine predators such as sharks. In this study, we examined liver, plasma, and muscle FAs in five coexisting pelagic sharks (blue (Prionace glauca), silky (Carcharhinus falciformis), bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus), pelagic thresher (Alopias pelagicus), and smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena)) inhabiting the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Results showed complex inter- and intra-individual and tissue variation among the five shark species. Based on multivariate analysis of the muscle FAs, P. glauca and C. falciformis have the largest FA niche widths, indicating diverse feeding habits or habitat isolation, whereas A. pelagicus and S. zygaena occupied a narrower niche width, reflecting increased trophic specialization. High percentages of muscle FA niche overlap indicated strong resource competition between S.zygaena and C. falciformis and a degree of dietary isolation by P. glauca. Interpretations of feeding ecology differed based on the analysis of plasma FAs, which could be attributed to higher dietary FA turnover rates. The liver was deemed unsuitable to examine FA niche metrics based on high and unexplained intra-specific variance in liver FAs as well as the unique lipid metabolism in chondrichthyans. Overall, our multi-tissue approach revealed the magnitude of potential competitive interactions among coexisting tropical shark species. It also expanded our understanding of inter-tissue variability and best practices when using FA analysis to estimate trophic niche metrics of sharks.

Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are currently expanding across the global ocean due to climate change, leading to a compression of usable habitat for several marine species. Mercury stable isotope compositions provide a spatially and temporally integrated view of marine predator foraging habitat and its variability with environmental conditions. Here, we analyzed mercury isotopes in blue sharks Prionace glauca from normoxic waters in the northeastern Atlantic and from the world's largest and shallowest OMZ, located in the northeastern Pacific (NEP). Blue sharks from the NEP OMZ area showed higher Δ
104	35794151	The Australian Shark-Incident Database for quantifying temporal and spatial patterns of shark-human conflict.	We describe the Australian Shark-Incident Database, formerly known as the Australian Shark-Attack File, which contains comprehensive reports of 1,196 shark bites that have occurred in Australia over 231 years (1791-2022). Data were collated by the Taronga Conservation Society Australia using purpose-designed questionnaires provided to shark-bite victims or witnesses, media reports, and information provided by the department responsible for fisheries in each Australian state (including the Northern Territory). The dataset includes provoked and unprovoked bites from fresh, brackish, and marine waters in Australia. Data span 22 suspected shark species. This dataset will be publicly available, and can be used by analysts to decipher environmental, biological, and social patterns of shark bites in Australia. The information will aid scientists, conservationists, authorities, and members of the public to make informed decisions when implementing or selecting mitigation measures.
105	35791901	Morphological pattern of the dermal denticles of the Southern sawtail catshark Galeus mincaronei Soto, 2001.	Dermal denticles cover the skin of sharks for protection and may have additional functions, depending on the environment. The aim of the present study was to analyze the morphological pattern of dermal denticles across the body of the poorly known deep-water catshark Galeus mincaronei, which is endemic to Southern Brazil. Additionally, we aimed to identify differences between sexes and stages of sexual maturity. For this purpose, we analyzed patches of eight skin samples from body regions, that is, the head, body, and tail. Dermal denticles were imaged using scanning electron microscopy. Measurements of crown morphological variations (length and width) and density of dermal denticles were performed. Nine characters of dermal denticle morphology were selected to describe a morphological pattern using principal component analysis (PCA). The first PCA axis explained 45.2% of the variation, the second explained 33%, and the third explained 14.3%, together explaining 92.5% of the total variation in denticle morphology. We identified three groups of dermal denticle crown morphologies and their possible functions. The first was composed of nostril and snout denticles, which might suggest abrasion strength functions; the second was composed of most body denticles, such as those in the cranium, on the left side of the body, and on the pectoral, dorsal, and caudal fins, which might be related to generalized functions; and the third was composed of only caudal crest denticles, which might indicate defense functions with hydrodynamic properties in G. mincaronei. Likewise, our results reveal variations in dermal denticle morphology and arrangement along the three maturity stages considered in both sexes. Similarly, sexual dimorphism in the crown width and morphology of dermal denticles was observed in developing and mature individuals. Our results are the first to reveal the morphological variation of dermal denticles in relation to function, sex, and ontogeny of individual G. mincaronei.
106	35791055	Evaluation of efficacy of follicular unit extraction versus follicular unit extraction with platelet rich plasma in treatment of cicatricial alopecia.	"BACKGROUND: Follicular unit extraction (FUE) is a minimally invasive surgery that is becoming popular in hair restoration in cicatricial alopecia (CA).
AIM: Evaluation of FUE with or without platelet rich plasma (PRP) in scarring alopecia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with CA were randomized into two groups. Group A (10 patients) underwent FUE, group B (10 patients) underwent FUE + PRP. PRP was injected 1 week before surgery, then monthly after surgery for 3 months. Follow up was done after 3, 6 and 12 months by calculating the density of surviving follicular units and the survival rate.
RESULTS: In group A, there was statistically significant increase in mean survival rate which was 30.30%. At 3 months, 67.26% at 6 months and 78.15% at 12 months. In group B, there was a significant increase in mean survival rate being 30.14% at 3 months, 58.75% at 6 months and 69.74% at 12 months. There was no significant difference between both groups at anytime during follow up period.
CONCLUSION: Follicular unit extraction is a preferred procedure for hair restoration in CA with few side effects. The role of PRP in HT is controversial. In the present study, PRP does not significantly affect the survival rate of hair grafts."
107	35790145	Determination of fluorine distribution in shark teeth by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy.	Quantifying the chemical composition of fast-growing hard tissues in the environment can shed valuable information in terms of understanding ecosystems both prehistoric and current. Changes in chemical composition can be correlated with environmental conditions and can provide information about the organism's life. Sharks can lose 0.1 to 1.1 teeth/day, depending on species, which offers a unique opportunity to record environmental changes over a short duration of time. Shark teeth contain a biomineral phase that is made up of fluorapatite [Ca5(PO4)3F], and the F distribution within the tooth can be correlated to tooth hardness. Typically, this is determined by bulk acid digestion, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), or wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy. Here we present laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) as an alternative and faster approach for determining F distribution within shark teeth. Using a two-volume laser ablation chamber (TwoVol3) with innovative embedded collection optics for LIBS, shark teeth were investigated from sand tiger (Carcharias Taurus), tiger (Galeocerdo Cuvier), and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrnidae). Fluorine distribution was mapped using the CaF 603 nm band (CaF, Β 2Σ+ → X 2Σ+) and quantified using apatite reference materials. In addition, F measurements were cross referenced with EDS analyses to validate the findings. Distributions of F (603 nm), Na (589 nm), and H (656 nm) within the tooth correlate well with the expected biomineral composition and expected tooth hardness. This rapid methodology could transform the current means of determining F distribution, particularly when large sample specimens (350 mm2, presented here) and large quantities of specimens are of interest.
108	35789811	Recent Progress in Microalgal Squalene Production and Its Cosmetic Application.	Squalene, [oxidized form squalane] is a terpenoid with biological activity that produced by animals and plants. In the human body, a significant excretion named as sebum includes squalene in 12 percent. This bioactive compound shows anti-inflammatory, detoxifying, moisturizing and antioxidant effects on the human body. In addition to having these properties, it is known that squalene production decreases as less sebum is produced with age. Because of that, the need for supplementation of squalene through products has arisen. As a result, squalene production has been drawn attention due to its many application possibilities by cosmetic, cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical fields. At this point, approximately 3,000 of sharks, the major and the most popular source of squalene must be killed to obtain 1 ton of squalene. These animals are on the verge of extinction. This situation has caused to focus on finding microalgae strains, which are sustainable producers of squalene as alternative to sharks. This review paper summarizes the recent progresses in the topic of squalene. For this purpose, it contains information on squalene producers, microalgal squalene production and cosmetic evaluation of squalene.
109	35783202	Extraction of Biocompatible Collagen From Blue Shark Skins Through the Conventional Extraction Process Intensification Using Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents.	The disposal of large amounts of skin waste resulting from the blue shark fishing industry presents several industrial and environmental waste management concerns. In addition, these marine subproducts are interesting sources of collagen, a fibrous protein that shows high social and economic interest in a broad range of biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications. However, blue shark wasted skins are a poorly explored matrix for this purpose, and conventional collagen recovery methodologies involve several pre-treatment steps, long extraction times and low temperatures. This work presents a new green and sustainable collagen extraction approach using a natural deep eutectic solvent composed of citric acid:xylitol:water at a 1:1:10 molar ratio, and the chemical characterization of the extracted collagen by discontinuous electrophoresis, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism. The extracted material was a pure type I collagen, and the novel approach presented an extraction yield 2.5 times higher than the conventional one, without pre-treatment of raw material and reducing the procedure time from 96 to 1 h. Furthermore, the

113	35773297	Mitigation of jet cross-flow induced vibrations using an innovative biomimetic nozzle design inspired by shark gill geometry.	"Shark gill slits enable sharks to eject the water after the oxygen has been removed in ram ventilation. The reduced effect of jet flow from the gill slits gives sharks smooth maneuverability. A biomimetic ""shark nozzle"" is proposed to improve mixing between the jet flow and surrounding fluid. Jet flow systems are an essential component of many industrial applications. The key characteristic of jet flow is the mixing process that occurs between two fluid streams to allow heat and/or mass transfer between them. Many industrial and propulsion devices that use jet flows need rapid mixing for effective and environmentally friendly operation. Fuel-injection systems, chemical reactors, and heating and air conditioning systems are examples of devices where a mixing process takes place. Recently, jet flow plays an important role in design and operation of specialized nuclear pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) holes and slots machined in the core periphery baffle plates are designed to mitigate the effects of a severe LOCA event. However, in normal operation, the holes are a source of a jet flow that can induced vibrations in the fuel assemblies near the baffle before being mixed with the surrounding fluid. This may cause wear and fretting in fuel rods with their supports. The ultimate solution to prevent the fuel assembly vibrations from LOCA hole jetting in a reactor is enhancing mixing of a jet flow with ambient flow in order to rapidly reduce jet momentum. This work proposes a new shark-inspired nozzle design that exploits the observed high efficiency capacity of shark gill slits. Tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the new design. The obtained results show that the shark-inspired biomimetic nozzle has a greater effect on the rod bundle vibration, and the critical velocity at which the unstable vibration occurs in the rod bundle is delayed by 20% using the biomimetic nozzle. In addition to delaying instability, a vibration amplitude reduction of 85% was obtained by using the proposed shark-inspired nozzle instead of the circular nozzle."
114	35765842	Decoding the dynamics of dental distributions: insights from shark demography and dispersal.	Shark teeth are one of the most abundant vertebrate fossils, and because tooth size generally correlates with body size, their accumulations document the size structure of populations. Understanding how ecological and environmental processes influence size structure, and how this extends to influence these dental distributions, may offer a window into the ecological and environmental dynamics of past and present shark populations. Here, we examine the dental distributions of sand tigers, including extant 
115	35765834	Sperm whales (Physeteroidea) from the Pisco Formation, Peru, and their trophic role as fat sources for late Miocene sharks.	Shark-cetacean trophic interactions, preserved as bite marks in the fossil record, mostly correspond to isolated or fragmentary findings that bear limited information about major trophic patterns or roles. Here, we provide evidence of focalized foraging by sharks in the form of tooth bite marks over physeteroids fossil bones from the late Miocene of Peru. These findings indicate that sharks were targeting the forehead of coeval physeteroids to actively feed on their lipid-rich nasal complexes. Miocene physeteroids displayed a broad diversity, including giant predatorial forms, small benthic foragers and suction feeders. Like their extant relatives, these animals exhibited enlarged fatty forehead organs responsible for their sound production capabilities, thus evolving taxon-specific cranial architecture. Bite marks are found on the cranial bones where these structures were attached, indicating that sharks actively targeted this region; but also, in areas that would only be accessible following the consumption of the surrounding soft tissues. The shape of the bite marks and their distribution suggests a series of consecutive scavenging events by individuals of different shark species. Similar bite patterns can be recognized on other Miocene physeteroids fossils from across the globe, suggesting that sharks actively exploited physeteroid carcasses as fat sources.

The nanoarchitectured egg cases of elasmobranchs rely on a hierarchically ordered latticework for their protective function─serving as an exemplary system for nanoscale self-assembly. Although the proteinaceous precursors are known to undergo intermediate liquid crystalline phase transitions before being structurally arrested in the final nanolattice architecture, their sequences have so far remained unknown. By leveraging RNA-seq and proteomic techniques, we identified a cohort of nanolattice-forming proteins comprising a collagenous midblock flanked by domains typically associated with innate immunity and network-forming collagens. Structurally homologous proteins were found in the genomes of other egg-case-producing cartilaginous fishes, suggesting a conserved molecular self-assembly strategy. The identity and stabilizing role of cross-links were subsequently elucidated using mass spectrometry and 
119	35747489	The Phylogeny of Rays and Skates (Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) Based on Morphological Characters Revisited.	Elasmobranchii are relatively well-studied. However, numerous phylogenetic uncertainties about their relationships remain. Here, we revisit the phylogenetic evidence based on a detailed morphological re-evaluation of all the major extant batomorph clades (skates and rays), including several holomorphic fossil taxa from the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and an extensive outgroup sampling, which includes sharks, chimaeras and several other fossil chondrichthyans. The parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses found more resolved but contrasting topologies, with the Bayesian inference tree neither supporting nor disfavouring any of them. Overall, the analyses result in similar clade compositions and topologies, with the Jurassic batomorphs forming the sister clade to all the other batomorphs, whilst all the Cretaceous batomorphs are nested within the remaining main clades. The disparate arrangements recovered under the different criteria suggest that a detailed study of Jurassic taxa is of utmost importance to present a more consistent topology in the deeper nodes, as issues continue to be present when analysing those clades previously recognized only by molecular analyses (e.g., Rhinopristiformes and Torpediniformes). The consistent placement of fossil taxa within specific groups by the different phylogenetic criteria is promising and indicates that the inclusion of more fossil taxa in the present matrix will likely not cause loss of resolution, therefore suggesting that a strong phylogenetic signal can be recovered from fossil taxa.
120	35746634	Single-Domain Antibodies as Therapeutics for Respiratory RNA Virus Infections.	Over the years, infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality disrupted human healthcare systems and devastated economies globally. Respiratory viruses, especially emerging or re-emerging RNA viruses, including influenza and human coronavirus, are the main pathogens of acute respiratory diseases that cause epidemics or even global pandemics. Importantly, due to the rapid mutation of viruses, there are few effective drugs and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of these RNA virus infections. Of note, a class of antibodies derived from camelid and shark, named nanobody or single-domain antibody (sdAb), was characterized by smaller size, lower production costs, more accessible binding epitopes, and inhalable properties, which have advantages in the treatment of respiratory diseases compared to conventional antibodies. Currently, a number of sdAbs have been developed against various respiratory RNA viruses and demonstrated potent therapeutic efficacy in mouse models. Here, we review the current status of the development of antiviral sdAb and discuss their potential as therapeutics for respiratory RNA viral diseases.

123	35736179	Comparison of Physicochemical and Structural Properties of Acid-Soluble and Pepsin-Soluble Collagens from Blacktip Reef Shark Skin.	Fish collagen has been widely used in tissue engineering (TE) applications as an implant, which is generally transplanted into target tissue with stem cells for better regeneration ability. In this case, the success rate of this research depends on the fundamental components of fish collagen such as amino acid composition, structural and rheological properties. Therefore, researchers have been trying to find an innovative raw material from marine origins for tissue engineering applications. Based on this concept, collagens such as acid-soluble (ASC) and pepsin-soluble (PSC) were extracted from a new type of cartilaginous fish, the blacktip reef shark, for the first time, and were further investigated for physicochemical, protein pattern, microstructural and peptide mapping.

128	35728548	Energetic costs and benefits of sleep.	Energy derived from food is a precious resource to animals. Those finite calories are often well-earned through exhaustive foraging effort, which can dominate waking hours, to support physiological processes (e.g. body maintenance and growth) and ecological necessities (e.g. predator avoidance and courting) that are pertinent to the production of progeny. So, it is unsurprising to find that animals have evolved strategies to guard against the gratuitous waste of hard-won caloric energy. Yet, it remains surprising to find such diversity, and elegant creativity, in those solutions. Brief examples of energy-saving innovation could include the very shape of animals and how they move, from streamlined swimming sharks to skyward-soaring seabirds; or the evolutionary appearance of various states of dormancy, such as endothermic animals sacrificing high body temperature through modest (torpor) or severe (hibernation) curtailments to metabolic heat production. Another reversibly dormant state with energetic benefits is sleep.

The species responsible for the attack was identified as a tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), based on both the victim's testimony and forensic examination. The victim suffered significant loss of soft tissues from one thigh, which resulted in hemorrhagic shock. Even though the event occurred at a remote location, miles away from the nearest hospital, appropriate first aid, immediate deployment of an alert system, and prompt helicopter transfer by an emergency rescue team allowed the victim to be transferred to an intensive care unit in stable condition and to undergo surgery within 4 h of being bitten. Early coverage of exposed bone was performed, followed up with negative pressure dressing, antibiotic treatment, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and a split skin graft. In spite of the massive muscular loss incurred, the victim was able to regain her ability to walk within 6 wk of the incident. Shark attacks on scuba divers are rare and seldom reported, especially in New Caledonia.
132	35714364	Production and Purification of Shark and Camel Single-Domain Antibodies from Bacterial and Mammalian Cell Expression Systems.	Single-domain antibodies, including the antigen-binding variable domains of the shark immunoglobulin new antigen receptor and the camelid variable region of the heavy chain, are the smallest antigen recognition domains (∼15 kDa) and have unique characteristics compared to conventional antibodies. They are capable of binding epitopes that are hard to access for classical antibodies and can also be used for therapeutics or diagnostics or as modular building blocks for multi-domain constructs, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins, or chimeric antigen receptor therapy. This article contains detailed procedures for the purification and validation of two single-domain antibodies (one shark and one camel), which bind to the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, using both bacterial and mammalian cell expression systems. It provides a comprehensive reference for the production of single-domain antibodies with high yield, good quality, and purity. © Published 2022.

133	35714082	Comparing eDNA metabarcoding primers for assessing fish communities in a biodiverse estuary.	Metabarcoding of environmental DNA is increasingly used for biodiversity assessments in aquatic communities. The efficiency and outcome of these efforts are dependent upon either de novo primer design or selecting an appropriate primer set from the dozens that have already been published. Unfortunately, there is a lack of studies that have directly compared the efficacy of different metabarcoding primers in marine and estuarine systems. Here we evaluate five commonly used primer sets designed to amplify rRNA barcoding genes in fishes and compare their performance using water samples collected from estuarine sites in the highly biodiverse Indian River Lagoon in Florida. Three of the five primer sets amplify a portion of the mitochondrial 12S gene (MiFish_12S, 171bp; Riaz_12S, 106 bp; Valentini_12S, 63 bp), one amplifies 219 bp of the mitochondrial 16S gene (Berry_16S), and the other amplifies 271 bp of the nuclear 18S gene (MacDonald_18S). The vast majority of the metabarcoding reads (> 99%) generated using the 18S primer set assigned to non-target (non-fish) taxa and therefore this primer set was omitted from most analyses. Using a conservative 99% similarity threshold for species level assignments, we detected a comparable number of species (55 and 49, respectively) and similarly high Shannon's diversity values for the Riaz_12S and Berry_16S primer sets. Meanwhile, just 34 and 32 species were detected using the MiFish_12S and Valentini_12S primer sets, respectively. We were able to amplify both bony and cartilaginous fishes using the four primer sets with the vast majority of reads (>99%) assigned to the former. We detected the greatest number of elasmobranchs (six species) with the Riaz_12S primer set suggesting that it may be a suitable candidate set for the detection of sharks and rays. Of the total 76 fish species that were identified across all datasets, the combined three 12S primer sets detected 85.5% (65 species) while the combination of the Riaz_12S and Berry_16S primers detected 93.4% (71 species). These results highlight the importance of employing multiple primer sets as well as using primers that target different genomic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that the widely adopted MiFish_12S primers may not be the best choice, rather we found that the Riaz_12S primer set was the most effective for eDNA-based fish surveys in our system.
134	35710034	Long-term monitoring of egg-laying cycle using ultrasonography reveals the reproductive dynamics of circulating sex steroids in an oviparous catshark, Scyliorhinus torazame.	The many diverse reproductive strategies of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) from lecithotrophic oviparity to matrotrophic viviparity have attracted significant research attention. However, the endocrine control of elasmobranch reproduction is less well-documented largely due to their reproductive characteristics, such as a long reproductive cycle, and/or repeated internal fertilization using stored sperm in oviparous species. In the present study, for the first time, we succeeded in non-invasive monitoring of the continuing egg-laying cycle of the cloudy catshark Scyliorhinus torazame using portable ultrasound devices. Furthermore, long-term simultaneous monitoring of the egg-laying cycle and measurement of plasma sex steroids revealed cycling patterns of estradiol-17β (E2), testosterone (T) and progesterone (P4). In particular, a decline in T followed by a reciprocal surge in plasma P4 were consistently observed prior to the appearance of the capsulated eggs, implying that P4 is likely associated with the ovulation and/or egg-case formation. While the cycling pattern of E2 was not as apparent as those of T and P4, threshold levels of E2 (>5 ng/mL) and T (>1 ng/mL) appeared to be crucial in the continuation of egg-laying cycle. The possibility to trace the dynamics of plasma sex steroids in a single individual throughout the reproductive cycles makes the catshark a useful model for regulatory and mechanistic studies of elasmobranch reproduction.
135	35705658	Drivers of parasite communities in three sympatric benthic sharks in the Gulf of Naples (central Mediterranean Sea).	Sharks play a key role in the functioning of marine ecosystems and maintenance of trophic web balance, including life cycles of parasites co-occurring in their habitats. We investigated the structure of parasite communities of three sympatric shark species (Etmopterus spinax, Galeus melastomus, and Scyliorhinus canicula) and explored both the influence of host features in shaping the communities and their role as biological indicators of environment stability in the Gulf of Naples (central Mediterranean Sea), a geographical area characterized by strong anthropic pressure. Parasites found were all trophic transmitted helminths with a complex life cycle, except Lernaeopoda galei, that is a ecto-parasite copepod. Communities were all similarly impoverished with 4-5 component species and low values of species richness and diversity. Higher abundance of cestode larvae of the genus Grillotia was found in G. melastomus, although their dominance in all host species suggests that the three sharks have a similar role as intermediate/paratenic hosts in local food webs. Similarly, high abundance of Grillotia larvae could also suggest the occurrence of high abundance of largest top predators in the area. Host morphological (fork length in S. canicula and G. melastomus and body condition index in G. melastomus) and physiological (sex and gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices in S. canicula) variables were differently correlated to parasite community structures depending by host species. Potential reasons for the present impoverished parasite communities are discussed.
136	35701513	Sixth sense in the deep-sea: the electrosensory system in ghost shark Chimaera monstrosa.	Animals that continually live in deep sea habitats face unique challenges and require adaptive specializations solutions in order to locate and identify food, predators, and conspecifics. The Ampullae of Lorenzini are specialized electroreceptors used by chondrichthyans for important biological functions. Ampullary organs of the ghost shark Chimaera monstrosa, a deep-sea species commonly captured as by-catch in the bottom trawl fishery, are here described for the first time using macroscopic, ultrastructural and histological approaches. The number of ampullary pores in C. monstrosa is about 700, distributed into the whole cephalic section of C. monstrosa, and organized in12 pore clusters and they are arranged into different configurations and form a distinct morphological pattern for this species, showing some anatomical peculiarities never described before in others cartilaginous fishes and may constitute an evolutionary adaptation of this ancient chondrichthyan species to the extreme environmental conditions of its deep sea niche.

138	35693755	Cranial morphology of the orectolobiform shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum Müller &amp; Henle, 1838.	Elasmobranchs, comprising sharks, skates, and rays, have a long evolutionary history extending back into the Palaeozoic. They are characterized by various unique traits including a predominantly cartilaginous skeleton, superficial prismatic phosphatic layer, and permanent tooth replacement. Moreover, they exhibit a more or less marked sexual dimorphism. Especially the morphology of the chondrocranium and the elements of the whole cranial region of extant and extinct chondrichthyans can provide valuable information about corresponding functions, e.g. the feeding apparatus might reflect the diet of the animals. However, studies on sexual dimorphisms are lacking in orectolobiform sharks, therefore, little is known about possible sexual dimorphic characters in the cranial region in this group. For this reason, we present in this study a comprehensive morphological description of the cranial region of the brownbanded bamboo shark 
139	35689516	The distribution, ecology and predicted habitat use of the Critically Endangered angelshark (Squatina squatina) in coastal waters of Wales and the central Irish Sea.	The angelshark (Squatina squatina) has the northernmost range of any angel shark species, but there is limited information on its distribution, habitat use and ecology at higher latitudes. To address this, Angel Shark Project: Wales gathered 2231 S. squatina records and 142 anecdotal resources from fishers, coastal communities and archives. These spanned the coastal waters of Wales and the central Irish Sea and were dated from 1812 to 2020, with 97.62% of records within 11.1 km (6 nm) of the coast. Commercial, recreational and charter boat fishers provided the majority of S. squatina records (97.18%), with significantly more sightings from three decades (1970s, 1980s and 1990s) and in the months of September, June, August and July (in descending order). The coastal area between Bardsey Island and Strumble Head had the most S. squatina records (n = 1279), with notable concentrations also found in Carmarthen Bay, Conwy Bay and the Outer Severn Estuary. Species distribution models (SDM) identified four environmental variables that had significant influence on S. squatina distribution, depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity, and these varied between the quarters (Q) of the year. SDM model outputs predicted a larger congruous area of suitable habitat in Q3 (3176 km
140	35687546	Using stable isotopes analysis to understand ontogenetic trophic variations of the scalloped hammerhead shark at the Galapagos Marine Reserve.	Changes in life-history requirements drive trophic variations, particularly in large marine predators. The life history of many shark species is still poorly known and understanding their dietary ontogeny is a challenging task, especially for highly migratory species. Stable isotope analysis has proven as a useful method for examining the foraging strategies of sharks and other marine predators. We assessed the foraging strategies and ontogenetic changes of scalloped hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna lewini, at Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), by analysing δ13C and δ15N signatures in different maturity stages. Our isotopic results suggest ontogenetic shifts in resource use between sub-adult and adult stages, but not between adult and juvenile stages. Carbon isotopic signatures found in the juvenile stage were enriched in contrast to sub-adults (~0.73‰) suggesting a combination of the maternal input and the use of coastal resources around the Galapagos Islands. Adult female sharks also showed enrichment in δ13C (~0.53‰) in comparison to sub-adult stages that suggest feeding in high primary productivity areas, such as the GMR. This study improves the understanding of the trophic ecology and ontogenetic changes of a highly migratory shark that moves across the protected and unprotected waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific.
141	35686686	Factors affecting gestation periods in elasmobranch fishes.	Gestation periods vary greatly across elasmobranch species. Differences in body size and body temperature (i.e. major determinants of metabolic rates) might explain such variation. Although temperature effects have been demonstrated for captive animals, body size effects remain undocumented. Moreover, whether metabolic rates of mothers or those of embryos affect gestation periods remains unclear. Because biological times generally scale with mass1-β, where β is metabolic scaling exponent (0.8-0.9 in fishes), we hypothesized that elasmobranch gestation periods would scale with mass0.1-0.2. We also hypothesized that regionally endothermic species with elevated metabolic rates should have shorter gestation periods than similar-sized ectothermic species if the metabolic rates of mothers are responsible. We compiled data on gestation periods for 36 elasmobranch species to show that gestation periods scale with M0.11 and m0.17, where M and m are adult female mass and birth mass, respectively. Litter size and body temperature also affected gestation periods. Our findings suggest that the body-mass dependence of metabolic rate explains some variations in elasmobranch gestation periods. Unexpectedly, regionally endothermic sharks did not have shorter gestation periods than their ectothermic counterparts, suggesting that the metabolic rates of embryos, which are likely ectothermic in all elasmobranch species, may be responsible. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
142	35685842	[Shark attacks in New Caledonia from 1958 to 2020: a review of cases].	"Background and objectives: Recent shark attacks in New Caledonia have prompted local authorities to elaborate a risk-management plan. The objective of the present paper is to produce detailed data on shark attacks that occurred in New Caledonian waters for the last few decades, as well as on the injuries of the victims, in order to inform rescue and medical services as well as authorities in charge of educating the public and providing security.
Methods: Incidents involving sharks and humans in New Caledonia for the last six decades were included into a database. Sharks were tentatively identified to species according to the shape, size and other external characteristics of injuries to the victims, together with witness accounts. The severity of shark bites was evaluated against the scale proposed by A.K. Lentz and co-authors (Am Surg. 2010;76:101-6).
Results: Sixty-seven shark-attack cases were recorded in New Caledonia from 1958 to 2020, of which 13 were lethal. The majority of the attacks concerned spearfishers and freedivers collecting invertebrates (58.5% of total). In the last decades, shark attacks may have increased towards bathers, swimmers and snorkelers (18.5%), and people taking part in water sports including surf, kitesurf, windsurf and SUP foil (14%). One scuba diver was also attacked (1.5%). Twenty attacks including 8 lethal ones were ascribed to the tiger shark 
Conclusions: Feeding incentive appeared to be a frequent factor triggering attacks. The education of the public should be promoted as a preventive measure aiming to reduce the risk of such accidents."
144	35681850	How Well Do 'Catch-Only' Assessment Models Capture Catch Time Series Start Years and Default Life History Prior Values? A Preliminary Stock Assessment of the South Atlantic Ocean Blue Shark Using a Catch-Based Model.	CMSY++, an improved version of the CMSY approach developed from Catch-MSY which uses a Bayesian implementation of a modified Schaefer model and can predict stock status and exploitation, was used in the present study. Evaluating relative performance is vital in situations when dealing with fisheries with different catch time series start years and biological prior information. To identify the influences of data inputs on CMSY++ outputs, this paper evaluated the use of a nominal reported catch and a reconstructed catch dataset of the South Atlantic blue shark alongside different priors of the blue shark's productivity/resilience (r) coupled with different indices of abundance. Results from the present study showed that different catch time series start years did not have a significant influence on the estimation of the biomass and fishing reference points reported by CMSY++. However, uninformative priors of r affected the output results of the model. The developed model runs with varying and joint abundance indices showed conflicting results, as classification rates in the final year changed with respect to the type of index used. However, the model runs indicated that South Atlantic blue shark stock could be overfished (B2020/Bmsy = 0.623 to 1.15) and that overfishing could be occurring (F2020/Fmsy = 0.818 to 1.78). This result is consistent with the results from a previous assessment using a state-space surplus production model applied for the same stock in 2015. Though some potential could be observed when using CMSY++, the results from this model ought to be taken with caution. Additionally, the continuous development of prior information useful for this model would help strengthen its performance.
145	35679282	High resolution acoustic telemetry reveals swim speeds and inferred field metabolic rates in juvenile white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias).	White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are the largest shark species to display regional endothermy. This capability likely facilitates exploitation of resources beyond thermal tolerance thresholds of potential sympatric competitors as well as sustained elevated swim speeds, but results in increased metabolic costs of adults, which has been documented in different studies. Little, however, is known of the metabolic requirements in free-swimming juveniles of the species, due to their large size at birth and challenges in measuring their oxygen consumption rates in captivity. We used trilateration of positional data from high resolution acoustic-telemetry to derive swim speeds from speed-over-ground calculations for eighteen free-swimming individual juvenile white sharks, and subsequently estimate associated mass-specific oxygen consumption rates as a proxy for field routine metabolic rates. Resulting estimates of mass-specific field routine metabolic rates (368 mg O2 kg-1 h-1 ± 27 mg O2 kg-1 h-1 [mean ± S.D.]) are markedly lower than those reported in sub-adult and adult white sharks by previous studies. We argue that median cruising speeds while aggregating at nearshore nursery habitats (0.6 m s-1 [mean ± S.E = 0.59 ± 0.001], 0.3 TL s-1) are likely a feature of behavioral strategies designed to optimize bioenergetic efficiency, by modulating activity rates in response to environmental temperature profiles to buffer heat loss and maintain homeostasis. Such behavioral strategies more closely resemble those exhibited in ectotherm sharks, than mature conspecifics.
146	35678278	The SHARK integral generation and digestion system.	In this paper, the SHARK integral generation and digestion engine is described. In essence, SHARK is based on a reformulation of the popular McMurchie/Davidson approach to molecular integrals. This reformulation leads to an efficient algorithm that is driven by BLAS level 3 operations. The algorithm is particularly efficient for high angular momentum basis functions (up to L = 7 is available by default, but the algorithm is programmed for arbitrary angular momenta). SHARK features a significant number of specific programming constructs that are designed to greatly simplify the workflow in quantum chemical program development and avoid undesirable code duplication to the largest possible extent. SHARK can handle segmented, generally and partially generally contracted basis sets. It can be used to generate a host of one- and two-electron integrals over various kernels including, two-, three-, and four-index repulsion integrals, integrals over Gauge Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAOs), relativistic integrals and integrals featuring a finite nucleus model. SHARK provides routines to evaluate Fock like matrices, generate integral transformations and related tasks. SHARK is the essential engine inside the ORCA package that drives essentially all tasks that are related to integrals over basis functions in version ORCA 5.0 and higher. Since the core of SHARK is based on low-level basic linear algebra (BLAS) operations, it is expected to not only perform well on present day but also on future hardware provided that the hardware manufacturer provides a properly optimized BLAS library for matrix and vector operations. Representative timings and comparisons to the Libint library used by ORCA are reported for Intel i9 and Apple M1 max processors.
147	35675323	Groovy and Gnarly: Surface Wrinkles as a Multifunctional Motif for Terrestrial and Marine Environments.	From large ventral pleats of humpback whales to nanoscale ridges on flower petals, wrinkled structures are omnipresent, multifunctional, and found at hugely diverse scales. Depending on the particulars of the biological system-its environment, morphology, and mechanical properties-wrinkles may control adhesion, friction, wetting, or drag; promote interfacial exchange; act as flow channels; or contribute to stretching, mechanical integrity, or structural color. Undulations on natural surfaces primarily arise from stress-induced instabilities of surface layers (e.g., buckling) during growth or aging. Variation in the material properties of surface layers and in the magnitude and orientation of intrinsic stresses during growth lead to a variety of wrinkling morphologies and patterns which, in turn, reflect the wide range of biophysical challenges wrinkled surfaces can solve. Therefore, investigating how surface wrinkles vary and are implemented across biological systems is key to understanding their structure-function relationships. In this work, we synthesize the literature in a metadata analysis of surface wrinkling in various terrestrial and marine organisms to review important morphological parameters and classify functional aspects of surface wrinkles in relation to the size and ecology of organisms. Building on our previous and current experimental studies, we explore case studies on nano/micro-scale wrinkles in biofilms, plant surfaces, and basking shark filter structures to compare developmental and structure-vs-function aspects of wrinkles with vastly different size scales and environmental demands. In doing this and by contrasting wrinkle development in soft and hard biological systems, we provide a template of structure-function relationships of biological surface wrinkles and an outlook for functionalized wrinkled biomimetic surfaces.

151	35665538	Status of Southeast Asia's marine sharks and rays.	In Southeast Asia, elasmobranchs are particularly threatened. We synthesized knowledge from the peer-reviewed and gray literature on elasmobranchs in the region, including their fisheries, status, trade, biology, and management. We found that 59% of assessed species are threatened with extinction and 72.5% are in decline; rays were more threatened than sharks. Research and conservation is complicated by the socioeconomic contexts of the countries, geopolitical issues in the South China Sea, and the overcapacity and multispecies nature of fisheries that incidentally capture elasmobranchs. The general paucity of data, funds, personnel, and enforcement hinders management. Reduced capacity in the general fishery sector and marine protected areas of sufficient size (for elasmobranchs and local enforcement capabilities) are among recommendations to strengthen conservation.
152	35661942	Habitat-specific fish fauna responses to different management regimes in the largest coral reef complex in the South Atlantic.	"While marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasing worldwide, it is still needed to assess the effectiveness of those already consolidated. Methods and ecological assessments to understanding integrated and habitat-specific management regimes are still scarce and insufficient for policy implications and biodiversity conservation. Through Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV), we used fish assemblages as proxy of ecological and managerial status in two reef habitat types along three protection levels at Abrolhos Bank - the largest and most biodiverse coral reef complex of the South Atlantic. We found completely distinct responses in the fish fauna between the top (shallow) and bottom (deep) habitats of the unique ""chapeirões"" pinnacle reef formations. In the most protected zone (no-take), higher richness and abundance of commercial fish and more diverse trophic structure was observed. Particularly, large (sharks and groupers) and small carnivores (snappers) were more abundant and distributed more homogeneously over both reef habitats in the strictly enforced no-take zone. Abundance of these top-predators decreased from the low enforcement no-take zone to the multiple use area, where they were often absent while their typical preys (primary and secondary consumers) were thriving, notably in the top habitats. These outcomes highlight the importance to focus investigations not selectively on a single habitat type or depth zone in order to properly assess MPA effectiveness. Consequently, the monitoring and protection of fish species supported by marine spatial planning may benefit from an improved understanding of ecological functioning provided by MPA performance."
153	35661219	Serum protein electrophoresis reference intervals for six species of wild-sampled sharks in South Florida.	Serum proteins found in the blood have been used as diagnostic markers in both human and animal medicine. Evaluating proteins in the blood of sharks may be a valuable way to assess shark health. The purpose of this study was to perform serum protein electrophoresis from non-lethal blood samples of wild sharks and establish baseline values for six species off South Florida: blacknose (Carcharhinus acronotus), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), bull (Carcharhinus leucas), lemon (Negaprion brevirostris), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus), and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Two hundred and fifty-one serum samples were collected between 2015-2018 along with sex determination and morphometric measurements. Agarose gel analysis was performed using mammalian protein fraction delimits albumin, alpha 1-globulins, alpha 2-globulins, beta globulins, and gamma globulins alternatively defined as fractions 1-5. Reference electrophoretic profiles were established for each species, revealing the dominance of protein fractions 3 and 4. The fraction 3:4 ratio was determined for each shark and reference intervals for total solids, protein fractions, and fraction 3:4 ratio are reported for each species. There were no significant differences in total solids or protein fractions between males and females of any species. In both blacktip sharks and bull sharks, total solids was positively correlated with body size, but not in the other species evaluated. In blacknose sharks, the fraction 3:4 ratio was positively correlated with body condition. Results suggest that there may be differences in total solids values across dry and wet seasons for some species. Newly established reference intervals can now be utilized in future research to evaluate the health of captive sharks and to investigate the health status of individuals in the wild as well as relate health measures to environmental conditions.

Nagasaki Prefecture has many islands and is surrounded by seas, straits, gulfs, bays, and coves, giving it the second longest coastline in Japan after Hokkaido. We have collected more than 20,000 marine microbes and have been preparing an original marine microbial extract library, which contains small and mid-size biomolecules that may penetrate cell membranes and interfere with the intracellular protein-protein interaction involved in the development of autoinflammatory diseases such as familial Mediterranean fever. In addition, we have been developing an indoor shark farming system to prepare shark nanobodies that could be developed as potential therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases.

155	35642655	The occurrence and feeding of a critically endangered shark species, Oxynotus centrina in the Sea of Marmara.	"The angular roughshark, Oxynotus centrina (Linnaeus, 1758), is a rarely encountered deep-sea demersal shark species. It is listed as ""Critically Endangered"" in the IUCN's regional assessment for the Mediterranean. Like other sharks and rays, the angular roughshark is subject to by-catch in demersal trawl and longline fisheries. This study contributes new knowledge on (a) its occurrence, size and sex information; and (b) its feeding ecology in the Sea of Marmara. Data were collected on total length (TL), total weight (TW) and sex from unpublished research survey reports performed intermittently from 1994 to 2020. According to the data, O. centrina was mainly recorded from the muddy sand bottom type in the southwest region of the Marmara Sea, which has higher biodiversity of macrobenthic species than other regions. Different methodological approaches were conducted to understand its feeding, such as DNA metabarcoding and isotope analysis to identify its prey spectra and assign a trophic level. Sampled specimens were full of liquid in their stomachs without any discernible visually identifiable prey items. The metabarcoding analyses were also unsuccessful in identifying any prey items. Trophic position calculation based on nitrogen isotope in muscles highlighted that O. centrina has the highest trophic position compared to the other sharks and rays in the Sea of Marmara. Although it was found mainly feeding on polychaetes and sipunculids species from previous studies, the δ"

158	35638311	Citizen science reveals the population structure and seasonal presence of whale sharks in the Gulf of Thailand.	The whale shark Rhincodon typus is a broadly distributed and highly mobile planktivorous shark species. The sharks form predictable aggregations in many areas, providing the opportunity for cost-effective scientific monitoring through divers and other marine resource users. Sightings of individuals outside of these aggregate zones elsewhere in their range are typically rare. We used a citizen science-based approach to shed light on occurrence and seasonality in the waters around Koh Tao, Thailand and neighbouring islands in the Gulf of Thailand. Although there is a paucity of quantitative data, anecdotal reports suggest substantial declines in sightings in the early 2000s. We identified a total of 178 individual whale sharks (from 249 sightings) between 2004 and 2019, with most of these (84%) from the 2015-2019 time period due to an increase in sighting reports facilitated by social media and direct marketing. Size estimates were reported for 102 of the sightings, with a range of 2-6 m and mean of 3.7 m overall. Sex was reported for 27% of sightings, with a 2:1 female-to-male ratio. Modified maximum likelihood methods suggest whale sharks are transient to Koh Tao and surrounding areas, with whale shark sightings following the regional monsoon cycle. One international resighting was obtained from Malaysian waters (~700 km away). Encouraging citizen science participation is particularly useful in data-poor regions like the Gulf of Thailand, despite limitations in size and sex estimation reliability, which can play an important complementary role in dedicated research programs.

161	35622923	Bioinspired soft electroreceptors for artificial precontact somatosensation.	Artificial haptic sensors form the basis of touch-based human-interfaced applications. However, they are unable to respond to remote events before physical contact. Some elasmobranch fishes, such as seawater sharks, use electroreception somatosensory system for remote environmental perception. Inspired by this ability, we design a soft artificial electroreceptor for sensing approaching targets. The electroreceptor, enabled by an elastomeric electret, is capable of encoding environmental precontact information into a series of voltage pulses functioning as unique precontact human interfaces. Electroceptor applications are demonstrated in a prewarning system, robotic control, game operation, and three-dimensional object recognition. These capabilities in perceiving proximal precontact events can lenrich the functionalities and applications of human-interfaced electronics.
162	35621957	Identification of Anti-TNFα VNAR Single Domain Antibodies from Whitespotted Bambooshark (Chiloscyllium plagiosum).	Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), an important clinical testing factor and drug target, can trigger serious autoimmune diseases and inflammation. Thus, the TNFα antibodies have great potential application in diagnostics and therapy fields. The variable binding domain of IgNAR (VNAR), the shark single domain antibody, has some excellent advantages in terms of size, solubility, and thermal and chemical stability, making them an ideal alternative to conventional antibodies. This study aims to obtain VNARs that are specific for mouse TNF (mTNF) from whitespotted bamboosharks. After immunization of whitespotted bamboosharks, the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from the sharks, then the VNAR phage display library was constructed. Through phage display panning against mTNFα, positive clones were validated through ELISA assay. The affinity of the VNAR and mTNFα was measured using ELISA and Bio-Layer Interferometry. The binding affinity of 3B11 VNAR reached 16.7 nM. Interestingly, one new type of VNAR targeting mTNF was identified that does not belong to any known VNAR type. To understand the binding mechanism of VNARs to mTNFα, the models of VNARs-mTNFα complexes were predicted by computational modeling combining HawkDock and RosettaDock. Our results showed that four VNARs' epitopes overlapped in part with that of mTNFR. Furthermore, the ELISA assay shows that the 3B11 potently inhibited mTNFα binding to mTNFR. This study may provide the basis for the TNFα blockers and diagnostics applications.
163	35611588	Diversity and phylogenetic relationships of 'tetraphyllidean' Clade 3 (Cestoda) based on new material from orectolobiform sharks in Australia and Taiwan.	In an effort to expand knowledge of Clade 3-one of the ten clades that compose the non-monophyletic order 'Tetraphyllidea' all current members of which parasitise orectolobiform sharks-we targeted species of orectolobiform sharks that had not previously been examined for 'tetraphyllidean' cestodes. That work led to the discovery of three new species off Australia and Taiwan. Ambitalveolus gen. n. was erected to accommodate these species. Ambitalveolus costelloae gen. n. et sp. n., Ambitalveolus kempi sp. n., and Ambitalveolus penghuensis sp. n. differ from one another in scolex size, genital pore position, and number of marginal loculi, proglottids, and testes. Among 'tetraphyllideans', the new genus most closely resembles the two other genera in Clade 3. It differs from Carpobothrium Shipley et Hornell, 1906 in lacking anterior and posterior flap-like extensions of its bothridia; instead, its bothridia are essentially circular. It differs from Caulopatera Cutmore, Bennett et Cribb, 2010 in that its vitelline follicles are in two lateral bands, rather than circum-medullary, and in that its bothridia bear, rather than lack, conspicuous marginal loculi. A key to the three genera in Clade 3 is provided. A phylogenetic analysis including new sequence data for one of the three new species of Ambitalveolus gen. n., the only species of Caulopatera, and all four described species and one undescribed species of Carpobothrium supports previously hypothesised close affinities between Caulopatera and Carpobothrium, with the new genus as their sister group. This is the first report of 'tetraphyllidean' cestodes from the orectolobiform shark family Brachaeluridae Applegate. The association of the new species with orectolobiform sharks is consistent with those of the other members of Clade 3. However, whereas species of Carpobothrium and Caulopatera parasitise members of the hemiscylliid genus Chiloscyllium Müller et Henle, species of Amitalveolus gen. n. parasitise members of the Brachaeluridae and Orectolobidae Gill.
164	35607969	Observations of a species-record deep dive by a central Pacific female scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini).	A female scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) conducted a species record deep dive to 1240 m in coastal-pelagic waters off Hawaii Island. This extends the deepest known depth range of the species by over 200 m (650 ft) and highlights the question of the extent to which deep-diving activity is mediated by physiological constraints, such as temperature and oxygen availability.
165	35606841	Microbiome differences between wild and aquarium whitespotted eagle rays (Aetobatus narinari).	"BACKGROUND: Animal-associated microbiomes can be influenced by both host and environmental factors. Comparing wild animals to those in zoos or aquariums can help disentangle the effects of host versus environmental factors, while also testing whether managed conditions foster a 'natural' host microbiome. Focusing on an endangered elasmobranch species-the whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari-we compared the skin, gill, and cloaca microbiomes of wild individuals to those at Georgia Aquarium. Whitespotted eagle ray microbiomes from Georgia Aquarium were also compared to those of cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in the same exhibit, allowing us to explore the effect of host identity on the ray microbiome.
RESULTS: Long-term veterinary monitoring indicated that the rays in managed care did not have a history of disease and maintained health parameters consistent with those of wild individuals, with one exception. Aquarium whitespotted eagle rays were regularly treated to control parasite loads, but the effects on animal health were subclinical. Microbiome α- and β-diversity differed between wild versus aquarium whitespotted eagle rays at all body sites, with α-diversity significantly higher in wild individuals. β-diversity differences in wild versus aquarium whitespotted eagle rays were greater for skin and gill microbiomes compared to those of the cloaca. At each body site, we also detected microbial taxa shared between wild and aquarium eagle rays. Additionally, the cloaca, skin, and gill microbiomes of aquarium eagle rays differed from those of cownose rays in the same exhibit. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were at low abundance in all wild and aquarium rays.
CONCLUSION: For whitespotted eagle rays, managed care was associated with a microbiome differing significantly from that of wild individuals. These differences were not absolute, as the microbiome of aquarium rays shared members with that of wild counterparts and was distinct from that of a cohabitating ray species. Eagle rays under managed care appear healthy, suggesting that their microbiomes are not associated with compromised host health. However, the ray microbiome is dynamic, differing with both environmental factors and host identity. Monitoring of aquarium ray microbiomes over time may identify taxonomic patterns that co-vary with host health."
166	35606304	Enhanced squalene production by modulation of pathways consuming squalene and its precursor.	Fermentative production of squalene in yeast as an alternative approach to extracting squalene from sharks or plants has attracted significant interest. However, squalene accumulation is limited due to its inevitable high-flux allocation toward ergosterol synthesis. In this study, we described expression control of squalene monooxygenase (Erg1p), the first-step enzyme of ergosterol synthesis from squalene, to significantly reduce squalene loss. We replaced the ERG1 promoter (P
167	35595135	Decadal trends of mercury cycling and bioaccumulation within Everglades National Park.	Mercury (Hg) contamination has been a persistent concern in the Florida Everglades for over three decades due to elevated atmospheric deposition and the system's propensity for methylation and rapid bioaccumulation. Given declines in atmospheric Hg concentrations in the conterminous United States and efforts to mitigate nutrient release to the greater Everglades ecosystem, it was vital to assess how Hg dynamics responded on temporal and spatial scales. This study used a multimedia approach (water and biota) to examine Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) dynamics across a 76-site network within the southernmost portion of the region, Everglades National Park (ENP), from 2008 to 2018. Hg concentrations across matrices showed that air, water, and biota from the system were inextricably linked. Temporal patterns across matrices were driven primarily by hydrologic and climatic changes in the park and no evidence of a decline in atmospheric Hg deposition from 2008 to 2018 was observed, unlike other regions of the United States. In the Shark River Slough (SRS), excess dissolved organic carbon and sulfate were also consistently delivered from upgradient canals and showed no evidence of decline over the study period. Within the SRS a strong positive correlation was observed between MeHg concentrations in surface water and resident fish. Within distinct geographic regions of ENP (SRS, Marsh, Coastal), the geochemical controls on MeHg dynamics differed and highlighted regions susceptible to higher MeHg bioaccumulation, particularly in the SRS and Coastal regions. This study demonstrates the strong influence that dissolved organic carbon and sulfate loads have on spatial and temporal distributions of MeHg across ENP. Importantly, improved water quality and flow rates are two key restoration targets of the nearly 30-year Everglades restoration program, which if achieved, this study suggests would lead to reduced MeHg production and exposure.
168	35591772	Delineation of blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) nursery habitats in the north-western Gulf of Mexico.	Coevolution with predators leads to the use of low-risk habitats by many prey species, which promotes survival during early developmental phases. These nurseries are valued by conservation and management agencies because of their contributions to adult populations. However, the physical and geographic characteristics, like shallow depths and isolation from other marine habitats, that restrict access to predators and thereby reduce risk to juvenile animals can also limit scientific research. Consequently, many nursery habitats are still unidentified and understudied. Here we used gillnet monitoring from 1982 to 2018 to delineate blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) nurseries in the north-western Gulf of Mexico and elucidated their physical, environmental and biological characteristics. Nursery habitats within estuaries (<2% of spatial area) were proximate to the Gulf of Mexico and exhibited significantly lower variability in salinity than non-nurseries. However, relative abundances of predators and prey were not significant delineators of nursery habitats. As such, food and risk may not influence juvenile blacktip habitat use as expected. Alternatively, reduced osmoregulatory stress attributed to predictable environments likely provides advantageous conditions for blacktips to develop foraging and antipredator tactics, which is vital prior to the winter migration of juvenile sharks into the Gulf of Mexico.
169	35589892	Trace and rare earth element bioaccumulation in the spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus stellaris).	Metals (trace elements and rare earth elements, REEs) were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in blood, the liver, the kidney and muscle of ex situ spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus stellaris). The controlled environment in which these elasmobranchs were hosted allowed to assess a baseline level of metals in the different organs since exposure via water and food can be easily monitored. The highest arsenic, chromium, copper, and iron values were found in the liver, cobalt in the kidney, and cadmium and rubidium in muscle. The highest total trace elements content was found in the trend liver (75 mg kg
170	35583124	A Class of Shark-Derived Single-Domain Antibodies can Broadly Neutralize SARS-Related Coronaviruses and the Structural Basis of Neutralization and Omicron Escape.	"The identification of a novel class of shark-derived single domain antibodies, named vnarbodies that show picomolar affinities binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Wuhan and Alpha, Beta, Kappa, Delta, Delta-plus, and Lambda variants, is reported. Vnarbody 20G6 and 17F6 have broad neutralizing activities against all these SARS-CoV-2 viruses as well as other sarbecoviruses, including Pangolin coronavirus and Bat coronavirus. Intranasal administration of 20G6 effectively protects mice from the challenges of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan and Beta variants. 20G6 and 17F6 contain a unique ""WXGY"" motif in the complementary determining region 3 that binds to a hidden epitope on RBD, which is highly conserved in sarbecoviruses through a novel β-sheet interaction. It is found that the S375F mutation on Omicron RBD disrupts the structure of β-strand, thus impair the binding with 20G6. The study demonstrates that shark-derived vnarbodies offer a prophylactic and therapeutic option against most SARS-CoV-2 variants and provide insights into antibody evasion by the Omicron variant."
171	35582806	Grouping behaviour impacts on the parasitic pressure and squamation of sharks.	The evolution of grouping behaviour involves a complex trade-off of benefits and costs. Among the latter, an increase in the risk of parasitic transmission is a well-documented phenomenon that has likely promoted the evolution of defensive mechanisms in aquatic vertebrates. Here, we explore the relationship between grouping behaviour, parasitic richness (∼parasitic pressure), and the evolution of potential defensive traits in the squamation of sharks through phylogenetic, standard and zero-inflation regression models. Our results demonstrate that sharks that frequently aggregate show increased parasitic pressure, which may constitute an agent of selection. Accordingly, their squamation is characterized by large-scale crown insertion angles and low-scale coverage, which are interpreted as traits that compromise parasite attachment and survival. These traits are less evident in regions of the body and ecological groups that are subjected to high abrasive stress or increased drag. Thus, the squamation of sharks responds to a compromise between various functions, where protective and hydrodynamic roles prevail over the rest (e.g. ectoparasitic defence and bioluminescence aiding). This work establishes a quantitative framework for inferring parasitic pressure and social interaction from squamation traits and provides an empirical basis from which to explore these phenomena through early vertebrate and chondrichthyan evolution.
172	35578984	Morphological study of the oral denticles of the porbeagle shark Lamna nasus.	Oral denticles of sharks are composed by a crown, dentine covered by a layer of enameloid and pulp cavity, the same structure of the dermal denticles found across the body surface of most elasmobranchs. In addition, oral papillae and taste buds are distributed among denticles within the oropharyngeal cavity, playing a fundamental role for tasting as part of the chemosensory system of fishes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been employed as an important tool for the study of dermal denticles and other structures, as well as histology and more recently computed tomography (CT) scan analysis. Herein, the authors used two methods for the study of the morphology of the oropharyngeal cavity of Lamna nasus (Lamniformes), an oceanic and pelagic shark: SEM and CT scan. The general morphology of oral denticles studied herein is related to abrasion strength as they are diamond-shaped, lack lateral cusps and have less pronounced ridges. In addition, smooth ridges and broad rounded denticles could be related to prevent abrasion during food consumption and manipulation. Oral papillae had a round shape and were observed only under SEM. The densities of papillae were estimated in 100 per cm

Double tooth pathologies are important indicators of trauma, disease, diet, and feeding biomechanics, and are widely documented in mammals. However, diagnosis of double tooth pathologies in extinct non-mammalian vertebrates is complicated by several compounding factors including: a lack of shared terminology reflecting shared etiology, inconsistencies in definitions and key features within and outside of mammals (
174	35576676	Mercury bioaccessibility in fish and seafood: Effect of method, cooking and trophic level on consumption risk assessment.	The bioaccessible Hg fraction in fish and seafood commonly present in the Mediterranean diet was assessed through three distinct in vitro extraction schemes. Each extraction method provided different results, highlighting the lack of a universal methodology to estimate mercury (Hg) bioaccessibility in those matrices. Bioaccessible Hg fractions ranged from 10 to nearly 90% of total mercury (T-Hg) and increased in predator species (Swordfish - Xiphias gladius, Blue Shark - Prionace glauca and Tuna - Thunnus sp.). Among the three extractions tested, the Unified Bioaccessibility Method (UBM) provided the highest estimation of Hg bioaccessibility for consumers. The tested cooking procedures (frying, grilling and steaming) considerably reduced the bioaccessible fraction. Results indicate that bioaccessible Hg found in ingested fish and seafood is far below the levels set by the current safety risk assessment legislation. These findings highlight the importance of integrating bioaccessibility measurements in food safety legislation.

"Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) education prepares graduates to lead clinical improvement and innovation across practice settings. Advanced clinical knowledge, leadership skills, and the development of quality/safety competencies uniquely prepare the DNP program graduates to drive organizational change. Adding business and financial competencies to the skill set of DNP graduates strengthens the impact and value of their role on financial, quality, and operational outcomes. The Organizational Systems and Healthcare Financing course in a DNP program was redesigned to engage learners using an innovative approach to teach business and financial principles. This paper aims to (a) describe a novel ""Shark Tank"" approach whereby students develop and ""pitch"" their business proposals to a panel of healthcare executives; (b) share examples of impactful change projects by student teams; (c) report DNP course and program evaluations including students' satisfaction and perceptions of value and knowledge gained in business principles; and (d) report opportunities for bidirectional mentorship, faculty recruitment, and succession planning. The success of this innovative team-based approach for teaching business/financial skills better prepares future DNP leaders and has implications for other DNP programs. Using this teaching strategy created opportunities for faculty recruitment, succession planning, and bidirectional mentorship of DNP-prepared nurse leaders."

Development of tooth shape is regulated by the enamel knot signalling centre, at least in mammals. Fgf signalling regulates differential proliferation between the enamel knot and adjacent dental epithelia during tooth development, leading to formation of the dental cusp.

180	35535508	Parallel Evolution of Ameloblastic scpp Genes in Bony and Cartilaginous Vertebrates.	In bony vertebrates, skeletal mineralization relies on the secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins (Scpp) family whose members are acidic extracellular proteins posttranslationally regulated by the Fam20°C kinase. As scpp genes are absent from the elephant shark genome, they are currently thought to be specific to bony fishes (osteichthyans). Here, we report a scpp gene present in elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) that evolved from local tandem duplication of sparc-L 5' exons and show that both genes experienced recent gene conversion in sharks. The elasmobranch scpp is remarkably similar to the osteichthyan scpp members as they share syntenic and gene structure features, code for a conserved signal peptide, tyrosine-rich and aspartate/glutamate-rich regions, and harbor putative Fam20°C phosphorylation sites. In addition, the catshark scpp is coexpressed with sparc-L and fam20°C in tooth and scale ameloblasts, similarly to some osteichthyan scpp genes. Despite these strong similarities, molecular clock and phylogenetic data demonstrate that the elasmobranch scpp gene originated independently from the osteichthyan scpp gene family. Our study reveals convergent events at the sparc-L locus in the two sister clades of jawed vertebrates, leading to parallel diversification of the skeletal biomineralization toolkit. The molecular evolution of sparc-L and its coexpression with fam20°C in catshark ameloblasts provides a unifying genetic basis that suggests that all convergent scpp duplicates inherited similar features from their sparc-L precursor. This conclusion supports a single origin for the hypermineralized outer odontode layer as produced by an ancestral developmental process performed by Sparc-L, implying the homology of the enamel and enameloid tissues in all vertebrates.
181	35533277	Global collision-risk hotspots of marine traffic and the world's largest fish, the whale shark.	Marine traffic is increasing globally yet collisions with endangered megafauna such as whales, sea turtles, and planktivorous sharks go largely undetected or unreported. Collisions leading to mortality can have population-level consequences for endangered species. Hence, identifying simultaneous space use of megafauna and shipping throughout ranges may reveal as-yet-unknown spatial targets requiring conservation. However, global studies tracking megafauna and shipping occurrences are lacking. Here we combine satellite-tracked movements of the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, and vessel activity to show that 92% of sharks’ horizontal space use and nearly 50% of vertical space use overlap with persistent large vessel (>300 gross tons) traffic. Collision-risk estimates correlated with reported whale shark mortality from ship strikes, indicating higher mortality in areas with greatest overlap. Hotspots of potential collision risk were evident in all major oceans, predominantly from overlap with cargo and tanker vessels, and were concentrated in gulf regions, where dense traffic co-occurred with seasonal shark movements. Nearly a third of whale shark hotspots overlapped with the highest collision-risk areas, with the last known locations of tracked sharks coinciding with busier shipping routes more often than expected. Depth-recording tags provided evidence for sinking, likely dead, whale sharks, suggesting substantial “cryptic” lethal ship strikes are possible, which could explain why whale shark population declines continue despite international protection and low fishing-induced mortality. Mitigation measures to reduce ship-strike risk should be considered to conserve this species and other ocean giants that are likely experiencing similar impacts from growing global vessel traffic.
182	35525763	Mineralized collagen as a bioactive ink to support encapsulation of human adipose stem cells: A step towards the future of bone regeneration.	Bioprinting - printing with incorporated living cells - has earned special attention on tissue engineering approaches, aiming to closer reproduce the 3D microenvironment of the target tissue. However, it raises extra complexity related to the need to use cell-friendly printing conditions that still comply with material printing fidelity. Inspired by the composite nano structural organization of mineralized tissues, this work reports the efficiency of the chemical approach followed to in situ mineralize blue shark skin collagen, at a nano scale level, to ultimately produce stable inks. The influence of initial cellular density was evaluated by assessing three different concentrations (2.5, 5 and 7.5 × 10
183	35523325	Toxicological risk of mercury for fish and invertebrate prey in the Arctic.	We assessed the risks of mercury (Hg) to Arctic marine and freshwater fish by compiling published muscle Hg concentrations and information on tissue concentrations associated with adverse effects. The assessment included 333 groups of fish representing 35 genera and 14,002 individuals sampled from sites across the circumpolar Arctic. Mean or median Hg concentrations in fish muscle varied widely from 0.005 μg/g ww to a maximum of 2.2 μg/g ww. Results indicate that most (n = 139 of 333 or ~ 42%) Arctic fish are not at risk for Hg toxicity, based on the large number of fish mean or median muscle Hg concentrations below 0.1 μg/g ww. A smaller number of the identified groups (n = 76 of 333 or ~ 23%) of Arctic fish had mean or median Hg concentrations consistent with moderate (0.3-0.5 μg/g ww), high (0.5-2 μg/g ww), and severe risk (≥2 μg/g ww). Most of the fish with Hg concentrations in these risk categories were long-lived predators (e.g., non-anadromous Arctic char, northern pike, lake trout, Greenland halibut, Greenland shark). We also, for the first time, conducted a risk assessment of Arctic marine and freshwater invertebrates to evaluate the potential for Hg effects at lower trophic levels and to support risk assessment for Arctic fish. The vast majority (90%) of site-specific Hg or methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in taxa of marine and freshwater invertebrates (n = 321) were < 0.5 μg/g dw, which is well below critical body residues of Hg in aquatic invertebrates associated with acute and sublethal effects determined in laboratory dosing studies. As the screening-level approach we carried out in the present study is not indicative of actual effects, more studies which directly evaluate the effects of Hg exposure in Arctic fish species are needed. The information here will be of use to Article 22 (Effectiveness Evaluation) of the Minamata Convention.

185	35507458	Learning the Language of Medical Device Innovation: A Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Elective for Medical Students.	"PROBLEM: Physicians are playing a growing role as clinician-innovators. Academic physicians are well positioned to contribute to the medical device innovation process, yet few medical school curricula provide students opportunities to learn the conceptual framework for clinical needs finding, needs screening, concept generation and iterative prototyping, and intellectual property management. This framework supports innovation and encourages the development of valuable interdisciplinary communication skills and collaborative learning strategies.
APPROACH: Our university offers a novel 3-year-long medical student Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Elective in Biodesign (MSLIEB) that teaches medical device innovation in 4 stages: (1) seminars and small-group work, (2) shared clinical experiences for needs finding, (3) concept generation and product development by serving as consultants for biomedical engineering capstone projects, and (4) reflection and mentorship. The MSLIEB objectives are to: create a longitudinal interdisciplinary peer mentorship relationship between undergraduate biomedical engineering students and medical students, and encourage codevelopment of professional identities in relation to medical device innovation.
OUTCOMES: The MSLIEB enrolled 5 entering cohorts from 2017 to 2021 with a total of 37 medical student participants. The first full entering cohort of 12 medical students produced 8 mentored biomedical engineering capstone projects, 7 of which were based on clinical needs statements derived from earlier in the elective. Medical student participants have coauthored poster and oral presentations; contributed to projects that won WolfieTank, a university-wide competition modeled after the television show Shark Tank; and participated in the filing of provisional patents. Students reflecting on the course reported a change in their attitude towards existing medical problems, felt better-equipped to collaboratively design solutions for clinical needs, and considered a potential career path in device design.
NEXT STEPS: The MSLIEB will be scaled up by recruiting additional faculty, broadening clinical opportunities to include the outpatient setting, and increasing medical student access to rapid prototyping equipment."
186	35503843	Discovering Associations between Acoustic Emission and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Biomarkers from 10 Osteoarthritic Knees.	"OBJECTIVE: Acoustic emission (AE) sensed from knee joints during weight-bearing movements greatly increases with joint deterioration, but the relationship between AE patterns and specific anatomical damage, as seen for example in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is unknown. This knowledge is essential to validate AE biomarkers for the evaluation of knee joints, and forms the objective of this exploratory work to associate knee AE and MRI.
METHODS: A novel processing framework is proposed to enable direct correlation between static 3D MRI of knees and their dynamic 1D AE during sit-stand-sit movements. It comprises a method to estimate articular cartilage thickness according to joint angle from knee MRI, and a method to derive statistically representative waveform features according to joint angle from movement and load-dependent knee AE.
RESULTS: In 10 subjects diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, age 55~79 years and body mass index 25~35 kg/m2, a strong inverse relationship between knee AE and cartilage thickness in the medial tibiofemoral compartment around the fully standing position was observed. Knees with thinner articular cartilage generated more AE with higher amplitude, greater energy, longer duration, and higher frequencies, in agreement with the assumption of more intense articulation friction under full body weight.
CONCLUSION: AE provides promising quantitative biomarkers in knee joint disease.
SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide impetus for the further development of AE as a low-cost non-invasive biomarker modality to improve the management of knee joint disease."
187	35482011	Large and expensive brain comes with a short lifespan: The relationship between brain size and longevity among fish taxa.	Vertebrates show substantial interspecific variation in brain size in relation to body mass. It has long been recognized that the evolution of large brains is associated with both costs and benefits, and it is their net benefit which should be favoured by natural selection. On one hand, the substantial energetic cost imposed by the maintenance of neural tissue is expected to compromise the energetic budget of organisms with large brains and their investment in other critical organs (expensive brain framework, EBF) or important physiological process, such as somatic maintenance and repair, thus accelerating ageing that shortens lifespan, as predicted by the disposable soma theory (DST). However, selection towards larger brain size can provide cognitive benefits (e.g., high behavioural flexibility) that may mitigate extrinsic mortality pressures, and thus may indirectly select for slower ageing that prolongs lifespan, as predicted by the cognitive buffer hypothesis (CBH). The relationship between longevity and brain size has been investigated to date only among terrestrial vertebrates, although the same selective forces acting on those species may also affect vertebrates living in aquatic habitats, such as fish. Thus, whether this evolutionary trade-off for brain size and longevity exists on a large scale among fish clades remains to be addressed. In this study, using a global dataset of 407 fish species, I undertook the first phylogenetic test of the brain size/longevity relationship in aquatic vertebrate species. The study revealed a negative relationship between brain size and longevity among cartilaginous fish confirming EBF and DST. However, no pattern emerged among bony fish species. Among sharks and rays, the high metabolic cost of producing neural tissue transcends the cognitive benefits of evolving a larger brain. Consequently, my findings suggest that the cost of maintaining brain tissue is relatively higher in ectothermic species than in endothermic ones.
188	35479656	Industrial application of fish cartilaginous tissues.	Cartilage is primarily composed of proteoglycans and collagen. Bioactive compounds derived from animal cartilage, such as chondroitin sulfate and type II collagen, have multiple bioactivities and are incorporated in popular health products. The aging population and increases in degenerative and chronic diseases will stimulate the rapid growth of market demand for cartilage products. Commercial production of bioactive compounds primarily involves the cartilages of mammals and poultry. However, these traditional sources are associated zoonosis concerns; thus, cartilage products from the by-products of fish processing has gained increasing attention because of their high level of safety and other activities. In this review, we summarize the current state of research into fish-derived cartilage products and their application, and discuss future trends and tasks to encourage further expansion and exploitation. At present, shark cartilage is the primary source of marine cartilage. However, the number of shark catches is decreasing worldwide, owing to overfishing. This review considers the potential alternative fish cartilage sources for industrialization. Three keys, the sustainable production of fish, new fish-processing model, and market demand, have been discussed for the future realization of efficient fish cartilage use. The industrialization of fish-derived cartilage products is beneficial for achieving sustainable development of local economies and society.
189	35475478	Market surveys and social media provide confirmation of the endangered giant freshwater whipray Urogymnus polylepis in Myanmar.	The giant freshwater whipray Urogymnus polylepis is a threatened species that is vulnerable to riverine and coastal marine pressures. Despite its threatened status, the range of U. polylepis is still being determined. In this study, photographic evidence of U. polylepis in Myanmar was provided through market surveys (2017-2018) and social media (Sharks and Rays of Rakhine Facebook page, 2021). Urogymnus polylepis is exposed to fisheries and habitat degradation pressures in Myanmar; therefore, conservation management is likely needed to ensure populations persist into the future.
190	35468471	First report on metal and metalloid contamination of Ampullae of Lorenzini in sharks: A case study employing the Brazilian sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon lalandii from Southeastern Brazil as an ecotoxicological model.	Metal contamination has never been assessed in Ampullae of Lorenzini. This study employed Rhizoprionodon lalandii, as an ecotoxicological model to investigate potential metal accumulation in Ampullae of Lorenzini jelly. No differences between sexes were observed regarding jelly metal concentrations at Rio das Ostras (RJ) or Santos (SP). Statistically significant correlations were noted between total lengths (TL) and condition factors and several metals at both sampling sites, demonstrating the potential for Chondrichthyan sensory capacity disruption and possible effects on foraging success. Maternal metal transfer to Ampullae jelly was confirmed. Rhizoprionodon lalandii is thus, a good model to assess Ampullae of Lorenzini contamination, as this electrosensory organ seems to be highly vulnerable to metal contamination.
191	35450778	Microbial genetic engineering approach to replace shark livering for squalene.	Squalene is generally sourced from the liver oil of deep sea sharks (Squalus spp.), in which it accounts for 40-70% of liver mass. To meet the growing demand for squalene because of its beneficial effects for human health, three to six million deep sea sharks are slaughtered each year, profoundly endangering marine ecosystems. To overcome this unsustainable practice, microbial sources of squalene might offer a viable alternative to plant- or animal-based squalene, although only a few microorganisms have been found that are capable of synthesizing up to 30% squalene of dry biomass by native biosynthetic pathways. These squalene biosynthetic pathways, on the other hand, can be genetically manipulated to transform microorganisms into 'cellular factories' for squalene overproduction.
192	35449439	Retrospective genomics highlights changes in genetic composition of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and potential loss of a south-eastern Australia population.	Over the last century, many shark populations have declined, primarily due to overexploitation in commercial, artisanal and recreational fisheries. In addition, in some locations the use of shark control programs also has had an impact on shark numbers. Still, there is a general perception that populations of large ocean predators cover wide areas and therefore their diversity is less susceptible to local anthropogenic disturbance. Here we report on temporal genomic analyses of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) DNA samples that were collected from eastern Australia over the past century. Using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) loci, we documented a significant change in genetic composition of tiger sharks born between ~1939 and 2015. The change was most likely due to a shift over time in the relative contribution of two well-differentiated, but hitherto cryptic populations. Our data strongly indicate a dramatic shift in the relative contribution of these two populations to the overall tiger shark abundance on the east coast of Australia, possibly associated with differences in direct or indirect exploitation rates.
193	35449381	The distribution of manta rays in the western North Atlantic Ocean off the eastern United States.	In 2018, the giant manta ray was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We integrated decades of sightings and survey effort data from multiple sources in a comprehensive species distribution modeling (SDM) framework to evaluate the distribution of giant manta rays off the eastern United States, including the Gulf of Mexico. Manta rays were most commonly detected at productive nearshore and shelf-edge upwelling zones at surface thermal frontal boundaries within a temperature range of approximately 20-30 °C. SDMs predicted highest nearshore occurrence off northeastern Florida during April, with the distribution extending northward along the shelf-edge as temperatures warm, leading to higher occurrences north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina from June to October, and then south of Savannah, Georgia from November to March as temperatures cool. In the Gulf of Mexico, the highest nearshore occurrence was predicted around the Mississippi River delta from April to June and again from October to November. SDM predictions will allow resource managers to more effectively protect manta rays from fisheries bycatch, boat strikes, oil and gas activities, contaminants and pollutants, and other threats.

195	35446438	Thirty-five years of tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier relative abundance near Bimini, The Bahamas, and the Southeastern United States with a comparison across jurisdictional bounds.	Abundances of large sharks are reported to have declined worldwide, and in response various levels of fisheries management and conservation efforts have been established. For example, marine-protected areas have been suggested as a means to protect large expanses of ocean from fishing and other industrial activities (e.g., habitat destruction), and in 2011 The Commonwealth of The Bahamas established The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary. Nonetheless, assessing the effectiveness of conservation efforts is challenging because consistent long-term data sets of shark abundances are often lacking, especially throughout the Caribbean and The Bahamas. In this study, the authors investigated the catch rates and demographics of tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier caught in a fishery-independent survey near Bimini, The Bahamas, from 1984 to 2019 to assess relative abundance trends following the banning of longline fishing in 1993 and the subsequent establishment of the shark sanctuary. To contextualize the relative abundance trends near Bimini, the authors compared this to the relative abundance of tiger sharks in a fishery-dependent survey from the Southeastern USA (SE USA), conducted from 1994 to 2019. The data of this study suggest that local abundance of tiger sharks has been stable near Bimini since the 1980s, including after the ban of longline fishing and the implementation of the shark sanctuary. In comparison, the abundance near the SE USA has slowly increased in the past decade, following potential declines in the decade preceding the USA Shark Management Plan. The results of this study provide some optimism that current conservation efforts in The Bahamas have been effective to maintain local tiger shark abundance within the protected area. In addition, current fisheries management in the SE USA is allowing this species to recover within those waters.
196	35444863	Answering questions about the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP): Analogies to whales and sharks miss the boat.	This commentary discusses questions and misconceptions about HiTOP raised by Haeffel et al. (2021). We explain what the system classifies and why it is descriptive and atheoretical, highlighting benefits and limitations of this approach. We clarify why the system is organized according to patterns of covariation or comorbidity among signs and symptoms of psychopathology, and we discuss how it is designed to be falsifiable and revised in a manner that is responsive to data. We refer to the body of evidence for HiTOP's external validity and for its scientific and clinical utility. We further describe how the system is currently used in clinics. In sum, many of Haeffel et al.'s concerns about HiTOP are unwarranted, and for those concerns that reflect real current limitations of HiTOP, our consortium is working to address them, with the aim of creating a nosology that is comprehensive and useful to both scientists and clinicians.
197	35444192	Acoustic discrimination in the grey bamboo shark Chiloscyllium griseum.	Cognitive abilities of sharks are well developed and comparable to teleosts and other vertebrates. Most studies exploring elasmobranch cognitive abilities have used visual stimuli, assessing a wide range of discrimination tasks, memory retention and spatial learning abilities. Some studies using acoustic stimuli in a cognitive context have been conducted, but a basic understanding of sound induced behavioural changes and the underlying mechanisms involved are still lacking. This study explored the acoustic discrimination abilities of seven juvenile grey bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium griseum) using a Go/No-Go method, which so far had never been tested in sharks before. After this, the smallest frequency difference leading to a change in behaviour in the sharks was studied using a series of transfer tests. Our results show that grey bamboo sharks can learn a Go/No-Go task using both visual and acoustic stimuli. Transfer tests elucidated that, when both stimulus types were presented, both were used. Within the tested range of 90-210 Hz, a frequency difference of 20-30 Hz is sufficient to discriminate the two sounds, which is comparable to results previously collected for sharks and teleosts. Currently, there is still a substantial lack of knowledge concerning the acoustic abilities and sound induced behaviours of sharks while anthropogenic noise is constantly on the rise. New insights into shark sound recognition, detection and use are therefore of the utmost importance and will aid in management and conservation efforts of sharks.
198	35440756	Remarkable diversity of vomeronasal type 2 receptor (OlfC) genes of basal ray-finned fish and its evolutionary trajectory in jawed vertebrates.	"The vomeronasal type 2 receptor (V2R, also called OlfC) multigene family is found in a broad range of jawed vertebrates from cartilaginous fish to tetrapods. V2Rs encode receptors for food-related amino acids in teleost fish, whereas for peptide pheromones in mammals. In addition, V2Rs of teleost fish are phylogenetically distinct from those of tetrapods, implying a drastic change in the V2R repertoire during terrestrial adaptation. To understand the process of diversification of V2Rs in vertebrates from ""fish-type"" to ""tetrapod-type"", we conducted an exhaustive search for V2Rs in cartilaginous fish (chimeras, sharks, and skates) and basal ray-finned fish (reedfish, sterlet, and spotted gar), and compared them with those of teleost, coelacanth, and tetrapods. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses on 1897 V2Rs revealed that basal ray-finned fish possess unexpectedly higher number of V2Rs compared with cartilaginous fish, implying that V2R gene repertoires expanded in the common ancestor of Osteichthyes. Furthermore, reedfish and sterlet possessed various V2Rs that belonged to both ""fish-type"" and ""tetrapod-type"", suggesting that the common ancestor of Osteichthyes possess ""tetrapod-type"" V2Rs although they inhabited underwater environments. Thus, the unexpected diversity of V2Rs in basal ray-finned fish may provide insight into how the olfaction of osteichthyan ancestors adapt from water to land."

To quantify maternal provisioning of nutrients in the pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus) and the potential for negative impacts, the concentrations of trace elements (essential: Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn; nonessential: As, Ba, Cd, Hg, and Pb) and fractionation of stable isotopes (
201	35437805	Baseline Health and Nutritional Parameters of Wild Sand Tigers Sampled in Delaware Bay.	Species-specific hematological reference values are essential for diagnosis and treatment of disease and maintaining overall health of animals. This information is lacking for many species of elasmobranchs maintained in zoos and aquaria, thus reducing the effectiveness of care for these animals. Descriptive statistics and reference intervals were calculated for hematocrit and complete blood cell counts, biochemistry and protein electrophoresis parameters, trace minerals, vitamins, heavy metals, reproductive hormones, and fatty acids in the blood of 153 wild Sand Tigers Carcharias taurus of both sexes and a range of sizes caught in Delaware Bay (Delaware, USA). Mean hematocrit, total white blood cell counts, lymphocyte differentials, glucose, phosphorus, amylase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in juveniles than in adults. Levels of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and differences in selenium and eicosapentaenoic acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid) between males and females suggest that they are important parameters for improving Sand Tiger breeding success in managed care. Finally, blood metal levels for arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury suggest low levels of contaminant exposure for Sand Tigers during their summer residence in Delaware Bay. The results of this study provide baseline health parameters for wild Sand Tigers that will aid in effective maintenance of aquarium animals and contribute to a greater understanding of the biology of these sharks and efforts to accomplish sustainable management of their populations.
202	35437491	"A Novel ""Shark-Fin"" Pyramidal Achilles Bone-Tendon Allograft Surgical Technique for Delayed Reconstruction of Triceps Tendon Rupture and Review of the Literature."	"Purpose: Triceps tendon injuries are rare and often caused by direct trauma to the arm. There are no clear guidelines on the management of these and typically partial tears are treated conservatively whilst full thickness tears are treated with primary surgical repair. We aim to review the literature on the methods for triceps repair and propose a novel surgical technique.
Methods: A ""Medline"" and ""Embase"" literature search of titles and abstracts combining ""triceps brachii muscle,"" ""reconstruct/ed"" or ""reconstruction"" alongside ""reconstructive surgical procedures,"" and further cross referenced with ""repair/s/ed."" Excluded those related to brachial plexus injuries or general elbow trauma and removing duplicate results. 32 English results within 10 years were relevant and reviewed.
Results: A 50-year-old gentleman with a 4-month-old full thickness triceps tear was repaired with a novel surgical technique of using an Achilles bone-tendon allograft fashioned into a ""shark-fin"" pyramidal shape and secured to the proximal ulnar in a lock and key type construct. The tendon was secured to the triceps remnant using a Krackow stitch. Complete radiological and clinical recovery was made by 18 months postoperatively with return to full physical activity.The literature review concluded no consensus in the method of treatment for delayed triceps reconstruction.
Conclusion: The use of the bone-tendon allograft specifically shaped to fit congruently into an olecranon osteotomy site allows for direct bone-to-bone healing has not previously been mentioned in the literature. Results have been encouraging and the technique described is easily reproducible."
203	35435294	Conceptual frameworks and key questions for assessing the contribution of marine protected areas to shark and ray conservation.	"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are key tools in addressing the global decline of sharks and rays, with ""marine parks"" and ""shark sanctuaries"" of various configurations established to conserve shark populations. There is also a rapidly growing body of telemetry research used to assess MPA performance in shark protection. However, assessments of MPA efficacy in shark and ray conservation are compromised by inconsistent terminology, a lack of standardised approaches to assess how MPAs contribute to the overall conservation of sharks and rays, and ambiguity about integrating movement data into assessment processes. This paper presents a conceptual framework that standardises key terms and uses the concept of Portfolio Risk to fully describe how an MPA may contribute to shark and ray conservation. The framework also demonstrates how movement data can be integrated into the process and presents eight key questions that provide guidance for applying the framework. Understanding an MPA's contribution to shark and ray protection requires explicit consideration of the assessment scope, MPA type and purpose, the range of existing and potential threats, the species biology and ecology, and management and operational contexts. Ultimately, MPA contributions to shark and ray conservation differ according to a complex set of human and natural factors and interactions which should be carefully considered in MPA design, implementation and evaluation. Article Impact statement: Standardization of key terms and use of the portfolio risk concept describe how protected areas contribute to shark and ray conservation.

205	35428996	Heterodonty and ontogenetic shift dynamics in the dentition of the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier (Chondrichthyes, Galeocerdidae).	The lifelong tooth replacement in elasmobranch fishes (sharks, rays and skates) has led to the assemblage of a great number of teeth from fossil and extant species, rendering tooth morphology an important character for taxonomic descriptions, analysing phylogenetic interrelationships and deciphering their evolutionary history (e.g. origination, divergence, extinction). Heterodonty (exhibition of different tooth morphologies) occurs in most elasmobranch species and has proven to be one of the main challenges for these analyses. Although numerous shark species are discovered and described every year, detailed descriptions of tooth morphologies and heterodonty patterns are lacking or are only insufficiently known for most species. Here, we use landmark-based 2D geometric morphometrics on teeth of the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier to analyse and describe dental heterodonties among four different ontogenetic stages ranging from embryo to adult. Our results reveal rather gradual and subtle ontogenetic shape changes, mostly characterized by increasing size and complexity of the teeth. We furthermore provide the first comprehensive description of embryonic dental morphologies in tiger sharks. Also, tooth shapes of tiger sharks in different ontogenetic stages are re-assessed and depicted in detail. Finally, multiple cases of tooth file reversal are described. This study, therefore, contributes to our knowledge of dental traits across ontogeny in the extant tiger shark G. cuvier and provides a baseline for further morphological and genetic studies on the dental variation in sharks. Therefore, it has the potential to assist elucidating the underlying developmental and evolutionary processes behind the vast dental diversity observed in elasmobranch fishes today and in deep time.
206	35426523	Recent advances in the microbial production of squalene.	Squalene is a triterpene hydrocarbon, a biochemical precursor for all steroids in plants and animals. It is a principal component of human surface lipids, in particular of sebum. Squalene has several applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and medical sectors. It is essentially used as a dietary supplement, vaccine adjuvant, moisturizer, cardio-protective agent, anti-tumor agent and natural antioxidant. With the increased demand for squalene along with regulations on shark-derived squalene, there is a need to find alternatives for squalene production which are low-cost as well as sustainable. Microbial platforms are being considered as a potential option to meet such challenges. Considerable progress has been made using both wild-type and engineered microbial strains for improved productivity and yields of squalene. Native strains for squalene production are usually limited by low growth rates and lesser titers. Metabolic engineering, which is a rational strain engineering tool, has enabled the development of microbial strains such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica, to overproduce the squalene in high titers. This review focuses on key strain engineering strategies involving both in-silico and in-vitro techniques. Emphasis is made on gene manipulations for improved precursor pool, enzyme modifications, cofactor regeneration, up-regulation of limiting reactions, and downregulation of competing reactions during squalene production. Process strategies and challenges related to both upstream and downstream during mass cultivation are detailed.
207	35425668	Folk Classification and Factor Rotations: Whales, Sharks, and the Problems With the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP).	The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) uses factor analysis to group people with similar self-reported symptoms (i.e., like-goes-with-like). It is hailed as a significant improvement over other diagnostic taxonomies. However, the purported advantages and fundamental assumptions of HiTOP have received little, if any scientific scrutiny. We critically evaluated five fundamental claims about HiTOP. We conclude that HiTOP does not demonstrate a high degree of verisimilitude and has the potential to hinder progress on understanding the etiology of psychopathology. It does not lend itself to theory-building or taxonomic evolution, and it cannot account for multifinality, equifinality, or developmental and etiological processes. In its current form, HiTOP is not ready to use in clinical settings and may result in algorithmic bias against underrepresented groups. We recommend a bifurcation strategy moving forward in which the DSM is used in clinical settings while researchers focus on developing a falsifiable theory-based classification system.
208	35417474	A fossil assemblage from the mid-late Maastrichtian of Gavdos Island, Greece, provides insights into the pre-extinction pelagic ichthyofaunas of the Tethys.	The global body-fossil record of marine 'fishes' from the time interval immediately preceding the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction is markedly poor. This deficiency appears to be further exacerbated with regards to offshore and deep-water taxa, obscuring our understanding of the state and composition of corresponding vertebrate faunas at the onset of this major extinction event. Recent fieldwork in the mid-late Maastrichtian exposures of the Pindos Unit in Gavdos Island, Greece, yielded a small but informative sample of fossil 'fishes', which inhabited the Tethys approximately three to four million years before the extinction. In this work we describe this sample, which comprises between eight and nine discrete morphotypes of various size classes, belonging to †Ichthyodectoidei, Aulopiformes (†Dercetidae, †Enchodontidae, †Ichthyotringidae), cf. †Sardinioididae, as well as the hexanchid shark †Gladioserratus sp. The new material expands the faunal list for the Maastrichtian of Gavdos Island, and the Pindos Unit as a whole, and further allows for the description of a new genus and species of †Enchodontidae and a new species of †Ichthyotringidae. The two new taxa are found to be widespread in the Maastrichtian of the Pindos Unit. The overall character of the assemblage agrees with previous interpretations of an offshore and rather deep depositional environment for the fossiliferous horizons. Furthermore, it exhibits a higher diversity than, and little taxonomic overlap with penecontemporaneous teleost assemblages from the Tethys, and informs on the otherwise poorly known Maastrichtian offshore and deep-water marine ichthyofaunas of the region.
209	35411445	Sustained endocrine and exocrine function in the pancreas of the Pacific spiny dogfish post-feeding.	Secretions of the exocrine pancreas contain digestive enzymes integral to the digestive process. The Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus suckleyi) has a discrete pancreas, divided into two lobes termed the dorsal and ventral lobes. These lobes drain into the anterior intestine via a common duct to enable digestion. Previous studies have identified that the exocrine pancreas produces (co)lipases, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and low levels of chitinases; however, investigations into other digestive enzymes are limited. We detect the presence of lipase, trypsin, and carbohydrase and show that activities are equivalent between both lobes of the pancreas. Additionally, we sought to investigate the influence of a single feeding event (2% body weight ration of herring by gavage) on enzyme activities over an extended time course (0, 20, 48, 72, 168 h) post-feeding. The results indicate that there are no differences in pancreatic tissue digestive enzyme activities between fed or fasted states. Analysis of acinar cell circumference post-feeding demonstrates a significant increase at 20 and 48 h, that returns to fasting levels by 72 h. No significant changes were observed regarding whole-tissue insulin or glucagon mRNA abundance or with glucose transporter (glut) 1 or 3. Yet, a significant and transient decrease in glut4 and sodium glucose-linked transporter mRNA abundance was found at 48 h post-feeding. We propose that the constant enzyme activity across this relatively large organ, in combination with a relatively slow rate of digestion leads to an evenly distributed, sustained release of digestive enzymes regardless of digestive state.

Infectious and inflammatory diseases are the most frequently diagnosed pathologies in elasmobranchs maintained under human care. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used in veterinary medicine for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. Meloxicam is a commonly prescribed NSAID in elasmobranchs, but there are still no published pharmacokinetic (PK) studies supporting its use in this group of animals. In this study, meloxicam was administered at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg to eight healthy adult nursehound sharks (
212	35405792	What Is in Your Shark Fin Soup? Probably an Endangered Shark Species and a Bit of Mercury.	Shark fin soup, consumed by Asian communities throughout the world, is one of the principal drivers of the demand of shark fins. This near USD 1 billion global industry has contributed to a shark population declines of up to 70%. In an effort to arrest these declines, the trade in several species of sharks is regulated under the auspices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Despite this legal framework, the dried fins of trade-regulated sharks are frequently sold in markets and consumed in shark fin soup. Shark fins found in soups break down into a fibrous mass of ceratotrichia, meaning that identifying the species of sharks in the soup becomes impossible by visual methods. In this paper, we use DNA barcoding to identify the species of sharks found in bowls of shark fin soup collected in Singapore. The most common species identified in our samples was the blue shark (
213	35399704	A framework for mapping and monitoring human-ocean interactions in near real-time during COVID-19 and beyond.	"The human response to the COVID-19 pandemic set in motion an unprecedented shift in human activity with unknown long-term effects. The impacts in marine systems are expected to be highly dynamic at local and global scales. However, in comparison to terrestrial ecosystems, we are not well-prepared to document these changes in marine and coastal environments. The problems are two-fold: 1) manual and siloed data collection and processing, and 2) reliance on marine professionals for observation and analysis. These problems are relevant beyond the pandemic and are a barrier to understanding rapidly evolving blue economies, the impacts of climate change, and the many other changes our modern-day oceans are undergoing. The ""Our Ocean in COVID-19″ project, which aims to track human-ocean interactions throughout the pandemic, uses the new eOceans platform (eOceans.app) to overcome these barriers. Working at local scales, a global network of ocean scientists and citizen scientists are collaborating to monitor the ocean in near real-time. The purpose of this paper is to bring this project to the attention of the marine conservation community, researchers, and the public wanting to track changes in their area. As our team continues to grow, this project will provide important baselines and temporal patterns for ocean conservation, policy, and innovation as society transitions towards a new normal. It may also provide a proof-of-concept for real-time, collaborative ocean monitoring that breaks down silos between academia, government, and at-sea stakeholders to create a stronger and more democratic blue economy with communities more resilient to ocean and global change."
214	35395226	Presence of GnRH3 in sturgeon and the roles of GnRH1 and GnRH2 on the regulation of LH/FSH in mature female sterlet Acipenser ruthenus in vitro.	Three forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRHs), ArGnRH1, ArGnRH2, and ArGnRH3, were identified in sterlet. Compared with their orthologue, ArGnRH1 and ArGnRH2 have conserved core decapeptide but show low identity in the signal peptide and the rest of the sequences. The existence of the GnRH3 paralogue of sturgeon was predicted for the first time with TBLASTN by using the amino acid sequences of catshark and whale shark GnRH3 precursor as queries against the whole genome and transcript data of sterlet. The predicted ArGnRH3 cDNA sequence was composed of three exons containing all the elements of the GnRH family. The successful molecular cloning of GnRH3 from sterlets verified its expression in the brain of sturgeons. The analysis of the ArGnRH3 amino acid sequence revealed a completely conserved decapeptide sequence that shows 100% identity with the sequence of teleosts and differs in one amino acid with that of the cartilaginous fish (catshark and whale shark) at the 5th position. The structure of the phylogenetic tree showed that a total of 52 vertebrate GnRH sequences were clustered into three main clades corresponding to GnRH1, GnRH2, and GnRH3. The ArGnRH3 sequence is the oldest GnRH3 identified in teleosts. The tissue distribution analysis showed that ArGnRH1 was expressed in all the 13 examined tissues of females and in most of the tested tissues of male fish, with the highest expression in the pituitary and hypothalamus. ArGnRH2 is only expressed in the pituitary, hypothalamus, and gonads of both female and male sterlets. ArGnRH3 mRNA could be detected in the pituitary, hypothalamus, and gonad in both female and male fish. It is also present in the spleen, head kidney, and gill in female fish and in kidney and heart in male fish. However, the ArGnRH3 only showed weak expression in all the positive tissues. ArGnRH1 and ArGnRH2 active decapeptides were synthesized to investigate their roles on the regulation of LH/FSH using a mixed brain cell line from a sexually mature female sterlet. The results showed that ArGnRH1 and ArGnRH2 exerted different effects on the gene expression and release of gonadotropins. ArGnRH1 promoted the expression of fshβ significantly around 48 h, and the expression was suppressed when the treatment time was extended to 72 h. ArGnRH1 had no significant effects on the level of either mRNA or secreted lh in any of the tested treatment length or concentrations. Moreover, ArGnRH1 did not stimulate the activity of gonadotropins in the maturation stage of female sturgeons. ArGnRH2 promoted the expression of fshβ at 24 h and 48 h and increased mRNA level of lhβ at 6 h and 48 h, accompanied by the significant secretion of LH at 72 h, although the high mRNA level of fsh did not correlate with the secretion of FSH in ArGnRH2-treated groups. In conclusion, ArGnRH2 plays an important role in the maturation stage of female sterlets. Therefore, ArGnRH2 has the potential to induce ovulation and spermiation in sturgeons.
215	35391461	A new record of the rare Bigeye Sand Tiger shark Odontaspis noronhai Maul, 1955 (Lamniformes: Odontaspididae) from the northwestern Pacific, with notes on dentition.	In the Pacific Ocean, the rare Bigeye Sand Tiger shark Odontaspis noronhai has only been recorded twice, once from its central and once from its eastern part. Here we report the first record of this species from the northwestern Pacific. This specimen measuring 312 cm total length (TL) was captured off northeastern Taiwan (2525N, 12410E) from a depth of 100 m (in waters over 2100 m deep) in mid-December 2019, and was retrieved on 27 December 2019 when landed in port. Photo of the fresh specimen along with morphometric and meristic data and DNA information are provided herein. Dentition of the specimen is different from all other specimens by having two cusplets on at least one side of cusps on most of the teeth (vs. only one cusplet per side), and lower total tooth count (29/29 vs. 3438/3746). This record documents an extended distribution (about 7864 km westward from the central Pacific Ocean), and provides strong evidence for the wide distribution and mesopelagic characteristic of this poorly known species.
216	35391202	Scyliorhinus hachijoensis, a new species of catshark from the Izu Islands, Japan (Carcharhiniformes: Scyliorhinidae).	A new species of catshark genus Scyliorhinus, S. hachijoensis sp. nov., is described for the islands of Mikurajima, Hachijojima, and Torishima in southeastern Japan. Scyliorhinus hachijoensis has clasper hooks, which is a common feature in males of the most closely related species (S. torazame), but is distinguished by its coloration (presence of dark spots), the height of its anal fin (higher than the caudal peduncle), and the shape of pectoral and pelvic fins, and dermal denticles. Molecular data also corroborates the new species as a distinct and monophyletic taxon by nucleotide sequence analysis of three mitochondrial DNA regions.

Anelasma squalicola is a parasitic barnacle of members of the deep-water shark families Etmopteridae, Pentanchidae and Scyliorhinidae. We report the first published confirmation of this species in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, based on material collected off Costa Rica, its first record as a parasite of the Ninja lantern shark, Etmopterus benchley (Etmopteridae), and a new size record for the host. The information presented herein expands the knowledge (distribution and host usage) of this enigmatic species.
218	35388432	Different Genes are Recruited During Convergent Evolution of Pregnancy and the Placenta.	"The repeated evolution of the same traits in distantly related groups (convergent evolution) raises a key question in evolutionary biology: do the same genes underpin convergent phenotypes? Here, we explore one such trait, viviparity (live birth), which, qualitative studies suggest, may indeed have evolved via genetic convergence. There are >150 independent origins of live birth in vertebrates, providing a uniquely powerful system to test the mechanisms underpinning convergence in morphology, physiology, and/or gene recruitment during pregnancy. We compared transcriptomic data from eight vertebrates (lizards, mammals, sharks) that gestate embryos within the uterus. Since many previous studies detected qualitative similarities in gene use during independent origins of pregnancy, we expected to find significant overlap in gene use in viviparous taxa. However, we found no more overlap in uterine gene expression associated with viviparity than we would expect by chance alone. Each viviparous lineage exhibits the same core set of uterine physiological functions. Yet, contrary to prevailing assumptions about this trait, we find that none of the same genes are differentially expressed in all viviparous lineages, or even in all viviparous amniote lineages. Therefore, across distantly related vertebrates, different genes have been recruited to support the morphological and physiological changes required for successful pregnancy. We conclude that redundancies in gene function have enabled the repeated evolution of viviparity through recruitment of different genes from genomic ""toolboxes"", which are uniquely constrained by the ancestries of each lineage."
219	35386210	Design of Nonsmooth Groove Tire Bioinspired by Shark-Skin Riblet Structure.	As one of the major causes of traffic accidents on wet roads, hydroplaning is prone to occur when the traveling speed of a vehicle rises so high that the hydrodynamic pressure between pavement and tires equals inflation pressure. In this condition, the vehicle nearly loses braking and steering capacity. Inspired by the superior drag reduction function of shark-skin riblet, the purpose of this study is to arrange bionic nonsmooth structures at the bottom of longitudinal grooves to promote the hydroplaning performance without affecting other tire performances. A finite element model of 185/60R15 tire was employed and its accuracy was verified by loading tests with CSS-88100 electronic testing instrument. Meanwhile, a fluid domain model was founded by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The simulated critical hydroplaning speed was in accord with that obtained by the NASA empirical formula. Inspired by shark-skin riblet, three kinds of nonsmooth surfaces were exploited. In addition, the drag reduction rate, shear stress, and flow velocity distribution were compared for different grooves. Then, the optimized nonsmooth structure with the best drag reduction effect among three nonsmooth surfaces was arranged at the bottom of longitudinal grooves for bionic tire. Simulation results demonstrated that the bionic tire obviously decreased hydrodynamic lift and increased flow velocities. With these improvements, the critical hydroplaning speed was effectively improved for the bionic tire. These research results can be applied to the promotion of hydroplaning performance without degrading other tire performances.
220	35373594	Clinical and Radiologic Results of a Human Bone Graft Screw in Tarsometatarsal II/+III Arthrodesis.	"BACKGROUND: For arthrodesis of the tarsometatarsal joints, there is the possibility of using a transplant screw made of allogenic human bone material (Shark Screw). This article investigates the clinical outcome and radiologic integration of the allogenic bone screw for arthrodesis of the tarsometatarsal joints II/+III.
METHODS: This is a prospective study involving 20 feet of 17 patients who received TMT II/+III arthrodesis with an allogenic bone screw. A visual analog scale (VAS pain and function), Foot Function Index (FFI), American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) midfoot score, and Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) were used as measures to compare preoperative with postoperative results. Radiologic integration in the recipient bone was also evaluated.
RESULTS: A significant mean pre- to postoperative improvement of all evaluated scores has been observed (
CONCLUSION: With these first results of the allogenic bone screw in TMT II/+III arthrodesis, a significant improvement from preoperative to postoperative was confirmed in the collected scores, and a full radiographic integration was demonstrated in all feet."
221	35365676	A biologging database of juvenile white sharks from the northeast Pacific.	Species occurrence records are vital data streams in marine conservation with a wide range of important applications. From 2001-2020, the Monterey Bay Aquarium led an international research collaboration to understand the life cycle, ecology, and behavior of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in the southern California Current. The collaboration was devoted to tagging juveniles with animal-borne sensors, also known as biologging. Here we report the full data records from 59 pop-up archival (PAT) and 20 smart position and temperature transmitting (SPOT) tags that variously recorded pressure, temperature, and light-level data, and computed depth and geolocations for 63 individuals. Whether transmitted or from recovered devices, raw data files from successful deployments (n = 70) were auto-ingested from the manufacturer into the United States (US) Animal Telemetry Network's (ATN) Data Assembly Center (DAC). There they have attributed a full suite of metadata, visualized within their public-facing data portal, compiled for permanent archive under the DataONE Research Workspace member node, and are accessible for download from the ATN data portal.
222	35358889	Assessment of trace metal concentrations in Indian Ocean silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis and their toxicological concerns.	This study assessed the concentrations of nine trace metals from juvenile C. falciformis caught from Indian Ocean. This study also discussed the metal pollution index (MPI) and bioconcentration factor (BCF) of each element, and their correlations. Further, the potential health risks of consuming shark muscles (THI) were evaluated. Results showed the mean concentrations of 9 elements as follows: Cu (0.36 ± 0.17), Zn (5.19 ± 16.6), Pb (0.12 ± 0.23), Cd (0.17 ± 0.21), Cr (0.57 ± 1.61), Ni (0.086 ± 0.51), As (1.36 ± 0.83), Co (0.000073 ± 0.0074), and V (0.0024 ± 0.0094) mg/kg ww. The BCF values of the elements were higher than 1, with Co and V being the lowest indicating their bioaccumulative behavior. Correlation analysis showed MPI to be highly correlated with Cu, indicating its greater contributions to the total pollution load. Principal components analysis explained 81.0% of the variability in biometric characteristics and metal concentrations. Health risk assessment for consuming shark muscle in Taiwanese male and female adults suggests potential chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards.
223	35349175	Regional variation in multiple paternity in the brown smooth-hound shark Mustelus henlei from the northeastern Pacific.	Multiple paternity (MP) in the brown smooth-hound shark (Mustelus henlei) was assessed in 15 litters (15 mothers and 97 embryos) collected in the northern Gulf of California of which 86.7% were sired by more than one male (i.e., from 2 to 4 sires). When taken together with results from previous studies, this record indicates that there is regional variation in MP in M. henlei in the northeastern Pacific. This pattern is associated with variations in the reproductive traits of each population (e.g., female size and litter size). In the Gulf of California, the results of a generalized linear model (GLZ) indicated that the litters of larger females had a higher probability of MP compared to those of smaller females.
224	35346964	Comparison of Reptilian Genomes Reveals Deletions Associated with the Natural Loss of γδ T Cells in Squamates.	T lymphocytes or T cells are key components of the vertebrate response to pathogens and cancer. There are two T cell classes based on their TCRs, αβ T cells and γδ T cells, and each plays a critical role in immune responses. The squamate reptiles may be unique among the vertebrate lineages by lacking an entire class of T cells, the γδ T cells. In this study, we investigated the basis of the loss of the γδ T cells in squamates. The genome and transcriptome of a sleepy lizard, the skink 
225	35337464	Big insight from the little skate: Leucoraja erinacea as a developmental model system.	The vast majority of extant vertebrate diversity lies within the bony and cartilaginous fish lineages of jawed vertebrates. There is a long history of elegant experimental investigation of development in bony vertebrate model systems (e.g., mouse, chick, frog and zebrafish). However, studies on the development of cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates and rays) have, until recently, been largely descriptive, owing to the challenges of embryonic manipulation and culture in this group. This, in turn, has hindered understanding of the evolution of developmental mechanisms within cartilaginous fishes and, more broadly, within jawed vertebrates. The little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) is an oviparous cartilaginous fish and has emerged as a powerful and experimentally tractable developmental model system. Here, we discuss the collection, husbandry and management of little skate brood stock and eggs, and we present an overview of key stages of skate embryonic development. We also discuss methods for the manipulation and culture of skate embryos and illustrate the range of tools and approaches available for studying this system. Finally, we summarize a selection of recent studies on skate development that highlight the utility of this system for inferring ancestral anatomical and developmental conditions for jawed vertebrates, as well as unique aspects of cartilaginous fish biology.
226	35337064	From Sharks to Yeasts: Squalene in the Development of Vaccine Adjuvants.	Squalene is a natural linear triterpene that can be found in high amounts in certain fish liver oils, especially from deep-sea sharks, and to a lesser extent in a wide variety of vegeTable oils. It is currently used for numerous vaccine and drug delivery emulsions due to its stability-enhancing properties and biocompatibility. Squalene-based vaccine adjuvants, such as MF59 (Novartis), AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), or AF03 (Sanofi) are included in seasonal vaccines against influenza viruses and are presently being considered for inclusion in several vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemic threats. However, harvesting sharks for this purpose raises serious ecological concerns that the exceptional demand of the pandemic has exacerbated. In this line, the use of plants to obtain phytosqualene has been seen as a more sustainable alternative, yet the lower yields and the need for huge investments in infrastructures and equipment makes this solution economically ineffective. More recently, the enormous advances in the field of synthetic biology provided innovative approaches to make squalene production more sustainable, flexible, and cheaper by using genetically modified microbes to produce pharmaceutical-grade squalene. Here, we review the biological mechanisms by which squalene-based vaccine adjuvants boost the immune response, and further compare the existing sources of squalene and their environmental impact. We propose that genetically engineered microbes are a sustainable alternative to produce squalene at industrial scale, which are likely to become the sole source of pharmaceutical-grade squalene in the foreseeable future.

228	35333436	Predator-prey landscapes of large sharks and game fishes in the Florida Keys.	Interspecific interactions can play an essential role in shaping wildlife populations and communities. To date, assessments of interspecific interactions, and more specifically predator-prey dynamics, in aquatic systems over broad spatial and temporal scales (i.e., hundreds of kilometers and multiple years) are rare due to constraints on our abilities to measure effectively at those scales. We applied new methods to identify space-use overlap and potential predation risk to Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and permit (Trachinotus falcatus) from two known predators, great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and bull (Carcharhinus leucas) sharks, over a 3-year period using acoustic telemetry in the coastal region of the Florida Keys (USA). By examining spatiotemporal overlap, as well as the timing and order of arrival at specific locations compared to random chance, we show that potential predation risk from great hammerhead and bull sharks to Atlantic tarpon and permit are heterogeneous across the Florida Keys. Additionally, we find that predator encounter rates with these game fishes are elevated at specific locations and times, including a prespawning aggregation site in the case of Atlantic tarpon. Further, using machine learning algorithms, we identify environmental variability in overlap between predators and their potential prey, including location, habitat, time of year, lunar cycle, depth, and water temperature. These predator-prey landscapes provide insights into fundamental ecosystem function and biological conservation, especially in the context of emerging fishery-related depredation issues in coastal marine ecosystems.

230	35324946	Depth and benthic habitat influence shallow and mesophotic predatory fishes on a remote, high-latitude coral reef.	Predatory fishes on coral reefs continue to decline globally despite playing key roles in ecosystem functioning. Remote atolls and platform reefs provide potential refugia for predator populations, but quantitative information on their spatial distribution is required to establish accurate baselines for ongoing monitoring and conservation management. Current knowledge of predatory fish populations has been derived from targeted shallow diver-based surveys (<15 m). However, the spatial distribution and extent of predatory fishes on outer mesophotic shelf environments has remained under described. Middleton Reef is a remote, high-latitude, oceanic platform reef that is located within a no-take area in the Lord Howe Marine Park off eastern Australia. Here we used baited remote underwater stereo video to sample predatory fishes across lagoon and outer shelf habitats from depths 0-100 m, extending knowledge on use of mesophotic depths and habitats. Many predatory fish demonstrated clear depth and habitat associations over this depth range. Carcharhinid sharks and Carangid fishes were the most abundant predators sampled on Middleton Reef, with five predatory fishes accounting for over 90% of the predator fish biomass. Notably, Galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and the protected black rockcod (Epinephelus daemelii) dominated the predator fish assemblage. A higher richness of predator fish species was sampled on reef areas north and south of the lagoon. The more exposed southern aspect of the reef supported a different suite of predator fish across mesophotic habitats relative to the assemblage recorded in the north and lagoonal habitats, a pattern potentially driven by differences in hard coral cover. Biomass of predatory fishes in the more sheltered north habitats was twice that of other areas, predominantly driven by high abundances of Galapagos shark. This work adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the conservation value of isolated oceanic reefs and the need to ensure that lagoon, shallow and mesophotic habitats in these systems are adequately protected, as they support vulnerable ecologically and economically important predator fish assemblages.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy shows excellent potency against hematological malignancies, but it remains challenging to treat solid tumors, mainly because of a lack of appropriate antigenic targets and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The checkpoint molecule programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is widely overexpressed in multiple tumor types, and the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 interaction is a crucial mediator of immunosuppression in the TME. Here we constructed a semi-synthetic shark V
234	35306075	Legacy and emerging flame retardants in sharks from the Western North Atlantic Ocean.	Following the discontinuation of commercial polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) mixtures, a variety of alternative flame retardants (FRs) have been developed and employed. To understand the contamination status of these emerging FRs in marine fish and wildlife, we investigated their bioaccumulation in four shark species, including shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrhinchus; n = 26), porbeagle (Lamna nasus; n = 4), sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus; n = 6), and common thresher (Alopias vulpinus; n = 4), from coastal and offshore waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean. Median concentrations of emerging FRs, including dechlorane analogues (i.e., dechlorane plus, Dec-602, -603, and - 604), tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene (TBCT), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), and hexabromobenzene (HBBZ), ranged from 1.4-7.4, 10.2-22.4, 1.0-16.7, and 4.1-17.7 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively. Although concentrations of emerging FRs were generally 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than those of legacy FRs (i.e., PBDEs, 312-800 ng/g lw and hexabromocyclododecane or HBCDD, 17.2-99.3 ng/g lw), they were detected in more than 80% of the shark livers. Analysis of available biological data indicated that fork length significantly correlated with the concentrations of ΣPBDEs, HBCDD, ΣDechloranes or TBCT in shortfin mako livers. This indicates that longer-term exposure likely results in elevated FR concentrations in sharks. Our findings suggest likely exposure of western North Atlantic fish and wildlife to several emerging FRs, including dechloranes, BTBPE, HBBZ, and TBCT. Additional studies are needed to better elucidate their potential risks to fish and wildlife as well as the variety of environmental and biological factors influencing these risks.

Prionace glauca is a top predator, prone to bioaccumulate trace elements, representing the most captured elasmobranch species for human consumption in Peru. Concentrations of cadmium and lead in the edible muscle tissue of the blue shark captured in the south Peruvian coastal waters and offshore north-central Chile were determined.

(Elasmobranchii: Scyliorhinidae Gill, 1862) off Tunisia, with a key to species of the genus Echinocephalus.	Echinocephalus caniculus n. sp. (Nematoda, Gnathostomatidae Railliet, 1895) was isolated from the spiral valve of the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula (L.) from the waters off Kalaat El Andalous, North East Tunisia. This new species is mainly characterized by a cephalic bulb armed with 31-39 transverse rows of uncinated hooks, a comparatively long oesophagus, short spicules and the presence of a gubernaculum. The new species differs from its congeners by having four cervical sacs of almost equal length, a higher oesophagus/body length ratio, the arrangement of the caudal papillae, the absence of a medioventral preanal organ and numerous scattered `pores´ limited to the lateral side of the posterior part of the body. This is the first report of a member of the genus Echinocephalus Molin, 1858 from the Tunisian coast, and a new host and locality record for the Gnathostomatidae. A key to the species of Echinocephalus is provided.
238	35287199	How to stay together? Habitat use by three sympatric sharks in the western coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico.	Sharks are top predators and play an important role in the regulation of marine ecosystems at lower trophic position. Mustelus californicus, Sphyrna zygaena, and Isurus oxyrinchus prove to be important fishery resources along the western coast of Baja California Sur and cohabit the same coastal areas, probably sharing resources. However, our knowledge about ecological dynamics of multiple species coexisting and sharing similar habitat resources is still limited, particularly for predators such as sharks. Therefore, this study focuses on the analysis of trophic ecology of the sharks species, using carbon (
239	35277154	Creating a resident-centric rehabilitation research team.	"BACKGROUND: The 36-month Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) or Physiatry residency provides a number of multidisciplinary clinical experiences. These experiences often translate to novel research questions, which may not be pursued by residents due to several factors, including limited research exposure and uncertainty of how to begin a project. Limited resident participation in clinical research negatively affects the growth of Physiatry as a field and medicine as a whole. The two largest Physiatry organizations - the Association of Academic Physiatrists and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation - participate in the Disability and Rehabilitation Research Coalition (DRRC), seeking to improve the state of rehabilitation and disability research through funding opportunities by way of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). A paucity of new Physiatry researchers neutralizes these efforts.
RESULTS: This paper details the creation of a novel, multidisciplinary Rehabilitation Resident Research program that promotes resident research culture and production. Mirroring our collaborative clinical care paradigm, this program integrates faculty mentorship, institutional research collaborates (Neuroscience Nursing Research Center, Neuroscience Research Development Office) and departmental resources (Shark Tank competition) to provide resident-centric research support.
CONCLUSIONS: The resident-centric rehabilitation research team has formed a successful research program that was piloted from the resident perspective, facilitating academic productivity while respecting the clinical responsibilities of the 36-month PM&R residency. Resident research trainees are uniquely positioned to become future leaders of multidisciplinary and multispecialty collaborative teams, with a focus on patient function and health outcomes."

"BACKGROUND: Distal first metatarsal osteotomies are commonly performed operative procedures for hallux valgus deformity, and usually involve fixation with a metal screw. However, various bioabsorbable osteosynthesis materials have been in use for a number of years. One recent innovation is the Shark Screw
METHODS: In a prospective study, 15 patients underwent a Reversed L-Shaped osteotomy stabilized with the allogenic bone screw Radiological data on osteointegration of the screw and correction of the intermetatarsal angle were recorded. Furthermore, each follow-up examination included the collection of clinical data, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, evaluation of pain level, and patient's overall satisfaction.
RESULTS: Full osseous fusion of the osteotomy was seen in all patients. The bone screws were radiographically integrated after approximately 6.5 (±2.6) months. Neither nonunion nor failure occurred in any of our cases. Furthermore, we did not find any potential graft reaction. The AOFAS score improved significantly from 51.6 (±15.2) points to 90.9 (±10.3) (

244	35259943	Energy conservation characterizes sleep in sharks.	Sharks represent the earliest group of jawed vertebrates and as such, they may provide original insight for understanding the evolution of sleep in more derived animals. Unfortunately, beyond a single behavioural investigation, very little is known about sleep in these ancient predators. As such, recordings of physiological indicators of sleep in sharks have never been reported. Reduced energy expenditure arising from sustained restfulness and lowered metabolic rate during sleep have given rise to the hypothesis that sleep plays an important role for energy conservation. To determine whether this idea applies also to sharks, we compared metabolic rates of draughtsboard sharks (
245	35258589	Life in the slow lane: field metabolic rate and prey consumption rate of the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) modelled using archival biologgers.	Field metabolic rate (FMR) is a holistic measure of metabolism representing the routine energy utilization of a species living within a specific ecological context, thus providing insight into its ecology, fitness and resilience to environmental stressors. For animals that cannot be easily observed in the wild, FMR can also be used in concert with dietary data to quantitatively assess their role as consumers, improving understanding of the trophic linkages that structure food webs and allowing for informed management decisions. Here, we modelled the FMR of Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) equipped with biologger packages or pop-up archival satellite tags (PSATs) in two coastal inlets of Baffin Island (Nunavut) using metabolic scaling relationships for mass, temperature and activity. We estimated that Greenland sharks had an overall mean (±s.d.) FMR of 21.67±2.30 mg O2 h-1 kg-0.84 (n=30; 1-4 day accelerometer package deployments) while residing inside these cold-water fjord systems in the late summer, and 25.48±0.47 mg O2 h-1 kg-0.84 (n=6; PSATs) over an entire year. When considering prey consumption rate, an average shark in these systems (224 kg) requires a maintenance ration of 61-193 g of fish or marine mammal prey daily. As Greenland sharks are a lethargic polar species, these low FMR estimates, and corresponding prey consumption estimates, suggest they require very little energy to sustain themselves under natural conditions. These data provide the first characterization of the energetics and consumer role of this vulnerable and understudied species in the wild, which is essential given growing pressures from climate change and expanding commercial fisheries in the Arctic.
246	35258079	Emerging insights on effects of sharks and other top predators on coral reefs.	Predation is ubiquitous on coral reefs. Among the most charismatic group of reef predators are the top predatory fishes, including sharks and large-bodied bony fishes. Despite the threat presented by top predators, data describing their realized effects on reef community structure and functioning are challenging to produce. Many innovative studies have capitalized on natural experimental conditions to explore predator effects on reefs. Gradients in predator density have been created by spatial patterning of fisheries management. Evidence of prey release has been observed across some reefs, namely that potential prey increase in density when predator density is reduced. While such studies search for evidence of prey release among broad groups or guilds of potential prey, a subset of studies have sought evidence of release at finer population levels. We find that some groups of fishes are particularly vulnerable to the effects of predators and more able to capitalize demographically when predator density is reduced. For example, territorial damselfish appear to realize reliable population expansion with the reduction in predator density, likely because their aggressive, defensive behavior makes them distinctly vulnerable to predation. Relatedly, individual fishes that suffer from debilitating conditions, such as heavy parasite loads, appear to realize relatively stronger levels of prey release with reduced predator density. Studying the effects of predators on coral reefs remains a timely pursuit, and we argue that efforts to focus on the specifics of vulnerability to predation among potential prey and other context-specific dimensions of mortality hold promise to expand our knowledge.

The Caribbean reef shark, Carcharhinus perezi, is known to rest on the substrate, a behaviour not documented in any of its congeners. We quantified the swimming kinematics of C. perezi in the wild and found that the head yawed at a frequency 15% greater than the tail beat, but that the amplitude of the tail exceeded the head yaw by approximately 80% across the range of velocities measured. We found that C. perezi velocity, head yaw frequency, and tailbeat frequency were all less than its obligate ram ventilating congener C. limbatus.
249	35248695	The aquaporin 8 (AQP8) membrane channel gene is present in the elasmobranch dogfish (Squalus acanthias) genome and is expressed in brain but not in gill, kidney or intestine.	The transport mechanisms for water, ammonia and urea in elasmobranch gill, kidney and gastrointestinal tract remain to be fully elucidated. Aquaporin 8 (AQP8) is a known water, ammonia and urea channel that is expressed in the kidney and respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and teleost fish. However, at the initiation of this study in late 2019, there was no copy of an elasmobranch aquaporin 8 gene identified in the genebank even for closely related holocephalon species such as elephant fish (Callorhinchus milii) or for the elasmobranch little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). A transcriptomic study in spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) also failed to identify a copy. Hence this study has remedied this and identified the AQP8 cDNA sequence using degenerate PCR. Agarose electrophoresis of degenerate PCR reactions from dogfish tissues showed a strong band from brain cDNA and faint bands of a similar size in gill and liver. 5' and 3' RACE was used to complete the AQP8 cDNA sequence. Primers were then designed for further PCR reactions to determine the distribution of AQP8 mRNA expression in dogfish tissues. This showed that AQP8 is only expressed in dogfish brain and AQP8 therefore clearly can play no role in water, ammonia and urea transport in the gill, kidney or gastrointestinal tract. The role of AQP8 in dogfish brain remains to be determined.
250	35246276	Microbiome structure in large pelagic sharks with distinct feeding ecologies.	"BACKGROUND: Sharks play essential roles in ocean food webs and human culture, but also face population declines worldwide due to human activity. The relationship between sharks and the microbes on and in the shark body is unclear, despite research on other animals showing the microbiome as intertwined with host physiology, immunity, and ecology. Research on shark-microbe interactions faces the significant challenge of sampling the largest and most elusive shark species. We leveraged a unique sampling infrastructure to compare the microbiomes of two apex predators, the white (Carcharodon carcharias) and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), to those of the filter-feeding whale shark (Rhincodon typus), allowing us to explore the effects of feeding mode on intestinal microbiome diversity and metabolic function, and environmental exposure on the diversity of microbes external to the body (on the skin, gill).
RESULTS: The fecal microbiomes of white and whale sharks were highly similar in taxonomic and gene category composition despite differences in host feeding mode and diet. Fecal microbiomes from these species were also taxon-poor compared to those of many other vertebrates and were more similar to those of predatory teleost fishes and toothed whales than to those of filter-feeding baleen whales. In contrast, microbiomes of external body niches were taxon-rich and significantly influenced by diversity in the water column microbiome.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest complex roles for host identity, diet, and environmental exposure in structuring the shark microbiome and identify a small, but conserved, number of intestinal microbial taxa as potential contributors to shark physiology."
253	35219080	Legacy and emerging contaminants in the endangered filter feeder basking shark Cetorhinus maximus.	The status of contamination by chemical pollutants on large filter feeding sharks is still largely unknown. This study investigated for the first time the presence of legacy, emerging contaminants and trace elements in multiple tissues of basking sharks. In general, skin showed higher concentration of legacy and emerging contaminants probably due to pollutants being adsorbed onto the dermal denticles of the skin rather than accumulated in the tissue itself. Contaminants measured in both subcutaneous tissue and muscles appeared to strongly correlate with each other, indicating that the former might be a good proxy of muscle contamination in basking sharks. Considering the migratory nature of this species, longevity and feeding ecology, this species represents the perfect candidate to act as early warning bioindicator of regional contamination. In this context, non-lethal subcutaneous biopsies could allow the early detection of any temporal variation in the bioaccumulation of pollutants in the Mediterranean Sea.

Planktonic microbial communities mediate many vital biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems, yet compared to other aquatic ecosystems, like oceans, lakes, rivers or estuaries, they remain relatively underexplored. Our study site, the Florida Everglades (USA)-a vast iconic wetland consisting of a slow-moving system of shallow rivers connecting freshwater marshes with coastal mangrove forests and seagrass meadows-is a highly threatened model ecosystem for studying salinity and nutrient gradients, as well as the effects of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion. This study provides the first high-resolution phylogenetic profiles of planktonic bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities (using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) together with nutrient concentrations and environmental parameters at 14 sites along two transects covering two distinctly different drainages: the peat-based Shark River Slough (SRS) and marl-based Taylor Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph). Both bacterial as well as eukaryotic community structures varied significantly along the salinity gradient. Although freshwater communities were relatively similar in both transects, bacterioplankton community composition at the ecotone (where freshwater and marine water mix) differed significantly. The most abundant taxa in the freshwater marshes include heterotrophic

We investigated progestin and corticosteroid activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) from elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish belonging to the oldest group of jawed vertebrates. Comparison with the human PR provides insights into the evolution of steroid activation of the human PR. At 1 nM steroid, the elephant shark PR is activated by progesterone, 17-hydroxy-progesterone, 20β-hydroxy-progesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), and 11-deoxycortisol. The human PR, in comparison, is activated at 1 nM steroid, only by progesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone, indicating increased progestin and corticosteroid specificity during the evolution of the human PR. RU486, an important clinical antagonist of the human PR, did not inhibit progesterone activation of the elephant shark PR. Cys-528 in the elephant shark PR corresponds to Gly-722 in the human PR, which is essential for RU486 inhibition of the human PR. Confirming the importance of Cys-528 in the elephant shark PR, RU486 inhibited progesterone activation of the Cys528Gly mutant PR. To investigate the physiological relevance of Gly-722 in the human PR and Cys-528 in the elephant shark PR, we studied steroid activation of the Gly722Cys human PR and Cys528Gly elephant shark PR. Compared to the wild-type human PR, there was an increase in the activation of human Gly722Cys PR by11-deoxycortisol and a decrease in activation by corticosterone, which may have been important in selection for the mutation corresponding to the human glycine-722 PR that first evolved in the platypus PR, a basal mammal.

260	35178874	Fishing for DNA? Designing baits for population genetics in target enrichment experiments: Guidelines, considerations and the new tool supeRbaits.	Targeted sequencing is an increasingly popular next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for studying populations that involves focusing sequencing efforts on specific parts of the genome of a species of interest. Methodologies and tools for designing targeted baits are scarce but in high demand. Here, we present specific guidelines and considerations for designing capture sequencing experiments for population genetics for both neutral genomic regions and regions subject to selection. We describe the bait design process for three diverse fish species: Atlantic salmon, Atlantic cod and tiger shark, which was carried out in our research group, and provide an evaluation of the performance of our approach across both historical and modern samples. The workflow used for designing these three bait sets has been implemented in the R-package supeRbaits, which encompasses our considerations and guidelines for bait design for the benefit of researchers and practitioners. The supeRbaits R-package is user-friendly and versatile. It is written in C++ and implemented in R. supeRbaits and its manual are available from Github: https://github.com/BelenJM/supeRbaits.
261	35169123	Global patterns in functional rarity of marine fish.	Rare species, which represent a large fraction of the taxa in ecological assemblages, account for much of the biological diversity on Earth. These species make substantial contributions to ecosystem functioning, and are targets of conservation policy. Here we adopt an integrated approach, combining information on the rarity of species trait combinations, and their spatial restrictedness, to quantify the biogeography of rare fish (a taxon with almost 13,000 species) in the world's oceans. We find concentrations of rarity, in excess of what is predicted by a null expectation, near the coasts and at higher latitudes. We also observe mismatches between these rarity hotspots and marine protected areas. This pattern is repeated for both major groupings of fish, the Actinopterygii (bony fish) and Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates and rays). These results uncover global patterns of rarity that were not apparent from earlier work, and highlight the importance of using metrics that incorporate information on functional traits in the conservation and management of global marine fishes.
262	35157279	Humanization of Camelid Single-Domain Antibodies.	Humanization of therapeutic antibodies derived from animal immunizations is often required to minimize immunogenicity risks in humans, which can cause potentially harmful and serious side effects and reduce antibody efficacy. Humanization is typically applied to conventional monoclonal antibodies derived in rodents as well as single-domain antibodies isolated from camelids and sharks (VHHs and VNARs). A streamlined protocol is described here for sequence humanization of camelid VHHs, which represent a promising biotherapeutic format with many desirable attributes. From human framework selection and complementarity-determining region grafting strategies to empirical scoring for prioritization of back-mutations, step-by-step instructions, and templates are provided along with bioinformatics resources to assist each step of the humanization process. Alternative approaches, warnings, and caveats are also presented.
263	35157269	Preparation of Immune and Synthetic VNAR Libraries as Sources of High-Affinity Binders.	The shark-derived autonomous variable antibody domains known as VNARs are attractive tools for therapeutic and diagnostic applications due to their favorable properties like small size (approximately 12 kDa), high thermal and chemical stability, and good tissue penetration. Currently, different techniques have been reported to generate VNAR domains against targets of therapeutic interest. Here, we describe methods for the preparation of an immune VNAR library based on bacteriophage display, and for the preparation of a synthetic library of VNAR domains using a modified protocol based on Kunkel mutagenesis. Finally, we describe procedures for in silico maturation of a VNAR using a bioinformatic approach to obtain higher affinity binders.
264	35157267	Overview, Generation, and Significance of Variable New Antigen Receptors (VNARs) as a Platform for Drug and Diagnostic Development.	The approval of the first VHH-based drug caplacizumab (anti-von Willebrand factor) has validated a two-decade long commitment in time and research effort to realize the clinical potential of single-domain antibodies. The variable domain (VNAR) of the immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR) found in sharks provides an alternative small binding domain to conventional monoclonal antibodies and their fragments and heavy-chain antibody-derived VHHs. Evolutionarily distinct from mammalian antibody variable domains, VNARs have enhanced thermostability and unusual convex paratopes. This predisposition to bind cryptic and recessed epitopes has facilitated both the targeting of new antigens and new (neutralizing) epitopes on existing antigens. Together these unique properties position the VNAR platform as an alternative non-antibody binding domain for therapeutic drug, diagnostic and reagent development. In this introductory chapter, we highlight recent VNAR advancements that further underline the exciting potential of this discovery platform.
265	35150990	Occurrence and levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in deep-sea sharks from Suruga Bay, Japan.	Few studies have investigated the prevalence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in deep-sea sharks. In this study, the levels and profiles of PBDEs were determined in liver samples of eight different species of deep-sea sharks collected in Suruga Bay, Japan. Widespread contamination of PBDEs in the deep-sea environment was reconfirmed in this study as these persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were detected in all specimens analyzed. Mean ΣPBDE levels in the deep-sea sharks ranged from 7 to 517 ng/g of lipid weight. The distribution patterns of BDE homologues were similar in all species where tetra-BDEs provided the dominant contribution to total PBDEs (46%). PBDEs levels were similar to, or higher than, those seen in other deep-sea sharks from different regions. The levels of PBDEs were likely to reflect their feeding preferences as higher PBDE levels were seen in species with higher trophic positions.
266	35150988	Elasmobranchs as bioindicators of pollution in the marine environment.	Bioindicator species are increasingly valuable in environmental pollution monitoring, and elasmobranch species include many suitable candidates for that role. By measuring contaminants and employing biomarkers of effect in relevant elasmobranch species, scientists may gain important insights about the impacts of pollution in marine ecosystems. This review compiles biomarkers applied in elasmobranchs to assess the effect of pollutants (e.g., metals, persistent organic pollutants, and plastics), and the environmental changes induced by anthropogenic activities (e.g., shifts in marine temperature, pH, and oxygenation). Over 30 biomarkers measured in more than 12 species were examined, including biotransformation biomarkers (e.g., cytochrome P450 1A), oxidative stress-related biomarkers (e.g., superoxide anion, lipid peroxidation, catalase, and vitamins), stress proteins (e.g., heat shock protein 70), reproductive and endocrine biomarkers (e.g., vitellogenin), osmoregulation biomarkers (e.g., trimethylamine N-oxide, Na
267	35149051	Divergent evolution of progesterone and mineralocorticoid receptors in terrestrial vertebrates and fish influences endocrine disruption.	There is much concern about disruption of endocrine physiology regulated by steroid hormones in humans, other terrestrial vertebrates and fish by industrial chemicals, such as bisphenol A, and pesticides, such as DDT. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals influence steroid-mediated physiology in humans and other vertebrates by competing with steroids for receptor binding sites, disrupting diverse responses involved in reproduction, development and differentiation. Here I discuss that due to evolution of the progesterone receptor (PR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) after ray-finned fish and terrestrial vertebrates diverged from a common ancestor, each receptor evolved to respond to different steroids in ray-finned fish and terrestrial vertebrates. In elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish that diverged before the separation between ray-finned fish and terrestrial vertebrates, both progesterone and 17,20β-dihydroxy-progesterone activate the PR. During the evolution of ray-finned fish and terrestrial vertebrates, the PR in terrestrial vertebrates continued responding to progesterone and evolved to weakly respond to 17,20β-dihydroxy-progesterone. In contrast, the physiological progestin for the PR in zebrafish and other ray-finned fish is 17,20β-dihydroxy-progesterone, and ray-finned fish PR responds weakly to progesterone. The MR in fish and terrestrial vertebrates also diverged to have different responses to progesterone. Progesterone is a potent agonist for elephant shark MR, zebrafish MR and other fish MRs, in contrast to progesterone's opposite activity as an antagonist for aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid for human MR. These different physiological ligands for fish and terrestrial vertebrate PR and MR need to be considered in applying data for their disruption by chemicals in fish and terrestrial vertebrates to each other.
268	35146740	Marine creatures dangerous for divers in tropical waters.	Diving has been gaining in popularity in recent years with spectacular dive sites in tropical waters. Before anyone goes diving, they should learn about the risk factors associated with the exposure to hyperbaric conditions and also the risks from exposure to marine life. Apart from amazing views of the coral reefs, divers may be astonished by the magnitude of marine species diversity in local waters, ranging from predators (sharks, barracuda, moray eels) to venomous or stinging fish (jellyfish, anemones) and sea snakes. If travelers are unprepared and know little about the existing risk factors, a diving trip that was much looked forward to may turn out to have some very unpleasant consequences. The article describes the most common marine species which divers can come across in tropical waters. It also discusses the management of injuries caused by dangerous marine creatures.

271	35132104	Extensive oceanic mesopelagic habitat use of a migratory continental shark species.	The identification of movement and behaviour patterns, as well as inter- and intra-population connectivity is crucial in order to implement effective and functional management and conservation measures for threatened migratory species such as tope (Galeorhinus galeus). Yet, previous studies struggled to elucidate clear and consistent movement and depth usage patterns of adult tope in the Northeast Atlantic, suggesting a high plasticity in the migration and behaviour. We deployed pop-up satellite archival tags on adult tope during their seasonal summer aggregations in the inner German Bight of the south-eastern North Sea and near a presumed mating site in southwest Scotland. Depth distribution and migration pathways were derived from time series data with location processing. Four individuals followed migration trajectories leaving coastal areas and crossed the European shelf slope into oceanic areas of the Northeast Atlantic, remaining fully pelagic for the rest of the deployment duration. These sharks showed far-ranging migration trajectories and undertook regular and frequent diel vertical migrations, reaching daytime depths of over 700 m. Vertical migration patterns closely overlapped with biological mesopelagic habitat structures and closely tracked the diel migration of organisms from deep scattering layers derived from hydroacoustic recordings. It is hypothesized that adult tope regularly utilize oceanic habitats, foraging on mesopelagic layers in an environment generally considered of low prey density.
272	35129649	The Epidermal Microbiome Within an Aggregation of Leopard Sharks (Triakis semifasciata) Has Taxonomic Flexibility with Gene Functional Stability Across Three Time-points.	The epidermis of Chondrichthyan fishes consists of dermal denticles with production of minimal but protein-rich mucus that collectively, influence the attachment and biofilm development of microbes, facilitating a unique epidermal microbiome. Here, we use metagenomics to provide the taxonomic and functional characterization of the epidermal microbiome of the Triakis semifasciata (leopard shark) at three time-points collected across 4 years to identify links between microbial groups and host metabolism. Our aims include (1) describing the variation of microbiome taxa over time and identifying recurrent microbiome members (present across all time-points); (2) investigating the relationship between the recurrent and flexible taxa (those which are not found consistently across time-points); (3) describing the functional compositions of the microbiome which may suggest links with the host metabolism; and (4) identifying whether metabolic processes are shared across microbial genera or are unique to specific taxa. Microbial members of the microbiome showed high similarity between all individuals (Bray-Curtis similarity index = 82.7, where 0 = no overlap, 100 = total overlap) with the relative abundance of those members varying across sampling time-points, suggesting flexibility of taxa in the microbiome. One hundred and eighty-eight genera were identified as recurrent, including Pseudomonas, Erythrobacter, Alcanivorax, Marinobacter, and Sphingopxis being consistently abundant across time-points, while Limnobacter and Xyella exhibited switching patterns with high relative abundance in 2013, Sphingobium and Sphingomona in 2015, and Altermonas, Leeuwenhoekiella, Gramella, and Maribacter in 2017. Of the 188 genera identified as recurrent, the top 19 relatively abundant genera formed three recurrent groups. The microbiome also displayed high functional similarity between individuals (Bray-Curtis similarity index = 97.6) with gene function composition remaining consistent across all time-points. These results show that while the presence of microbial genera exhibits consistency across time-points, their abundances do fluctuate. Microbial functions however remain stable across time-points; thus, we suggest the leopard shark microbiomes exhibit functional redundancy. We show coexistence of microbes hosted in elasmobranch microbiomes that encode genes involved in utilizing nitrogen, but not fixing nitrogen, degrading urea, and resistant to heavy metal.

There is a common phenomenon in nature whereby some animals have differences in their ontogenetic changes in dietary preferences between sexes, especially apex predators. These reflect changes in the needs of development during their lifetimes. Apex predators potentially have diverse dietary niches and a large impact on the trophic dynamics within ecosystems. However, the difference in life history between males and females often leads to increased difficulty in management and conservation. In this study, 25 oceanic whitetip sharks,

COVID-19 and subsequent government health containment measures have slowed down economic activities worldwide, particularly tourism. With the number of foreign tourists entering Thailand during 2020 and 2021 greatly diminished, the number of tourists at marine and coastal attractions in Southern Thailand has declined as well. This study found evidence of a relationship between the decline of the number of tourists and marine resource recovery. This recovery appears in the form of cleaner beaches, clearer seawater and increased sighting of marine animals. Between 2020 and 2021, official reports found increased sighting of dugongs, dolphins, blacktip reef sharks, whale sharks, leopard sharks, sea turtles, green turtles, hawksbill turtles, and false killer whales at marine national parks in Southern Thailand. The study also found that, prior to the COVD-19 outbreak, the number of tourists at Patong Beach and Maya Bay exceeded their tourism carrying capacities. Finally, this study proposes eight policy measures related to tourism management for marine resource sustainability: conservation and recreation zoning, enforcing marine park closure, redesigning marine park entrance fee systems, ensuring adequate recreational facilities, stricter enforcement of the law, promoting alternative tourism sites, encouraging more inclusivity and participation in decision making processes, and enhancing public awareness.
277	35124066	Evaluation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in silky sharks Carcharhinus falciformis collected from Western Indian Ocean and human health risk assessment.	The silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) is the most abundant and widely distributed shark species in the marine system of tropical regions. However, it appears that there is limited information on USEPA 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentration in silky shark muscle tissue, which has together with the lack of a health risk assessment of human consumption of silky shark filets. The potential toxicity of PAHs in muscles of silky sharks and cancer and non-cancer risk of consumers were assessed. Results showed that the total PAHs (TPAHs) concentration in the muscle tissue of silky sharks was between 62 and 657 ng/g ww, with an average of 234 ± 221 (mean ± standard deviation) ng/g ww, and can be considered as minimally to moderately contaminated level. Naphthalene (NA), phenanthrene (PH), and fluoranthene (FLU) are the most abundant PAHs in silky sharks muscle tissue, accounting for 38.6%, 11.0%, and 19.0% of TPAHs, respectively. The average values of toxic benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) equivalent (TEQ
278	35123488	Early shape divergence of developmental trajectories in the jaw of galeomorph sharks.	"BACKGROUND: The onset of morphological differences between related groups can be tracked at early stages during embryological development. This is expressed in functional traits that start with minor variations, but eventually diverge to defined specific morphologies. Several processes during this period, like proliferation, remodelling, and apoptosis for instance, can account for the variability observed between related groups. Morphological divergence through development is often associated with the hourglass model, in which early stages display higher variability and reach a conserved point with reduced variability from which divergence occurs again to the final phenotype.
RESULTS: Here we explored the patterns of developmental shape changes in the lower jaw of two shark species, the bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) and the catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). These two species present marked differences in their foraging behaviour, which is reflected in their adult jaw morphology. By tracing the developmental sequence of the cartilage condensation, we identified the onset of cartilage for both species at around stage 31. Other structures that developed later without a noticeable anlage were the labial cartilages, which appear at around stage 33. We observed that the lower jaw displays striking differences in shape from the earliest moments, without any overlap in shape through the compared stages.
CONCLUSIONS: The differences observed are also reflected in the functional variation in feeding mechanism between both species. Likewise, the trajectory analysis shows that the main differences are in the magnitude of the shape change through time. Both species follow a unique trajectory, which is explained by the timing between stages."
279	35118516	Structure and permeability of the egg capsule of the placental Australian sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon taylori.	Shark placentae are derived from modifications to the fetal yolk sac and the maternal uterine mucosa. In almost all placental sharks, embryonic development occurs in an egg capsule that remains intact for the entire pregnancy, separating the fetal tissues from the maternal tissues at the placental interface. Here, we investigate the structure and permeability of the egg capsules that surround developing embryos of the placental Australian sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori) during late pregnancy. The egg capsule is an acellular fibrous structure that is 0.42 ± 0.04 μm thick at the placental interface between the yolk sac and uterine tissues, and 0.67 ± 0.08 μm thick in the paraplacental regions. This is the thinnest egg capsule of any placental shark measured so far, which may increase the diffusion rate of respiratory gases, fetal wastes, water and nutrients between maternal and fetal tissues. Molecules smaller than or equal to ~ 1000 Da can diffuse through the egg capsule, but larger proteins (~ 3000-26,000 Da) cannot. Similar permeability characteristics between the egg capsule of R. taylori and other placental sharks suggest that molecular size is an important determinant of the molecules that can be exchanged between the mother and her embryos during pregnancy.

In this study, we firstly determined the complete mitogenome of the Japanese topeshark (Hemitriakis japonica), which belong to the family Triakidae and was assessed as Endangered A2d on the IUCN Red List in 2021. The mitogenome is 17,301 bp long, has a high AT content (60.0%), and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, a control region and specially a 594 bp-long non-coding region between Cytb gene and tRNA-Thr gene. The novel non-coding region share high sequence similarity with segments of the former and latter genes, so it was recognized as a duplication remnant. In addition, the Cytb gene and tRNA-Thr gene tandemly duplicated twice while accompanied by being deleted once at least. This is the first report of mitogenomic gene-arrangement in Triakidae. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods based on the mitogenomic data of 51 shark species and two outgroups. In summary, basing on a novel type of gene rearrangements in houndshark mitogenome, the possibly rearranged process was analyzed and contributed further insight of shark mitogenomes evolution and phylogeny.

284	35078340	Suspension feeders: diversity, principles of particle separation and biomimetic potential.	Suspension feeders (SFs) evolved a high diversity of mechanisms, sometimes with remarkably convergent morphologies, to retain plankton, detritus and man-made particles with particle sizes ranging from less than 1 µm to several centimetres. Based on an extensive literature review, also including the physical and technical principles of solid-liquid separation, we developed a set of 18 ecological and technical parameters to review 35 taxa of suspension-feeding Metazoa covering the diversity of morphological and functional principles. This includes passive SFs, such as gorgonians or crinoids that use the ambient flow to encounter particles, and sponges, bivalves or baleen whales, which actively create a feeding current. Separation media can be flat or funnel-shaped, built externally such as the filter houses in larvaceans, or internally, like the pleated gills in bivalves. Most SFs feed in the intermediate flow region of Reynolds number 1-50 and have cleaning mechanisms that allow for continuous feeding. Comparison of structure-function patterns in SFs to current filtration technologies highlights potential solutions to common technical design challenges, such as mucus nets which increase particle adhesion in ascidians, vanes which reduce pressure losses in whale sharks and changing mesh sizes in the flamingo beak which allow quick adaptation to particle sizes.
285	35078332	Loss of an apex predator in the wild induces physiological and behavioural changes in prey.	Predators can impact prey via predation or risk effects, which can initiate trophic cascades. Given widespread population declines of apex predators, understanding and predicting the associated ecological consequences is a priority. When predation risk is relatively unpredictable or uncontrollable by prey, the loss of predators is hypothesized to release prey from stress; however, there are few tests of this hypothesis in the wild.

286	35077867	IgNAR antibody: Structural features, diversity and applications.	In response to the invasion of exogenous microorganisms, one of the defence strategies of the immune system is to produce antibodies. Cartilaginous fish is among those who evolved the earliest humoral immune system that utilizes immunoglobulin-type antibodies. The cartilaginous fish antibodies fall into three categories: IgW, IgM, and IgNAR. The shark Immunoglobulin Novel Antigen Receptor (IgNAR) constitutes disulfide-bonded dimers of two protein chains, similar to the heavy chain of mammalian IgGs. Shark IgNAR is the primary antibody of a shark's adaptive immune system with a serum concentration of 0.1-1.0 mg/mL. Its structure comprises of one variable (V) domain (VNAR) and five constant (C1 -C5) domains in the secretory form. VNARs are classified into several subclasses based on specific properties such as the quantity and position of additional non-canonical cysteine (Cys) residues in the VNAR. The VDJ recombination in IgNAR comprises various fragments; one variable component, three diverse sections, one joining portion, and a solitary arrangement of constant fragments framed in each IgNAR gene cluster. The re-arrangement happens just inside this gene cluster bringing about a VD1D2D3J segment. Therefore, four re-arrangement procedures create the entire VNAR space. IgNAR antibody can serve as an excellent diagnostic, therapeutic, and research tool because it has a smaller size, high specificity for antigen-binding, and perfect stability. The domain characterization, structural features, types, diversity and therapeutic applications of IgNAR molecules are highlighted in this review. It would be helpful for further research on IgNAR antibodies acting as an essential constituent of the adaptive immune system and a potential therapeutic agent.
287	35058667	A rational route to transformative decisions.	According to Paul (Transformative experience, 1st edn, Oxford University Press, 2014), transformative experiences pose a challenge to decision theory since their value cannot be anticipated. Building on Pettigrew's (in: Lambert, Schwenkler (eds) Becoming someone new: essays on transformative experience, choice, and change, Oxford University Press, pp 100-121, 2020) redescription, this paper presents a new approach to how and when transformative decisions can nevertheless be made rationally. Thanks to fundamental higher-order facts that apply to any kind of experience, an agent always at least knows the general shape of the utility space. This in combination with the knowledge about the non-transformative alternative in the choice set can enable rational decision-making despite the presence of a transformative experience. For example, this paper's approach provides novel arguments for why gender transition (cf. McKinnon in Res Philosophica 92(2):419-440, 2015) or staying childfree (cf. Barnes in Philos Phenomenol Res 91(3):775-786, 2015) can be rational.

Corticosteroids are hormones produced in vertebrates exerting gluco- and mineralocorticoid actions (GC and MC) mediated by specific receptors (GR and MR, respectively). In elasmobranchs, the major circulating corticosteroid is the 1α-hydroxycorticosterone (1α-OHB). This hormone acts as a MC, but to date its role as a GC has not been established. As there is no 1α-OHB standard available, here we employed a set of in vivo and ex vivo approaches to test GC actions of other corticosteroids in the lesser spotted catshark (
289	35053041	Deep Ensemble Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Classification Using Chest CT Images.	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and medicinal resources have become inadequate in several regions. Computed tomography (CT) scans are capable of achieving precise and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis compared to the RT-PCR test. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), find it useful to design COVID-19 diagnoses using chest CT scans. In this aspect, this study concentrates on the design of an artificial intelligence-based ensemble model for the detection and classification (AIEM-DC) of COVID-19. The AIEM-DC technique aims to accurately detect and classify the COVID-19 using an ensemble of DL models. In addition, Gaussian filtering (GF)-based preprocessing technique is applied for the removal of noise and improve image quality. Moreover, a shark optimization algorithm (SOA) with an ensemble of DL models, namely recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), is employed for feature extraction. Furthermore, an improved bat algorithm with a multiclass support vector machine (IBA-MSVM) model is applied for the classification of CT scans. The design of the ensemble model with optimal parameter tuning of the MSVM model for COVID-19 classification shows the novelty of the work. The effectiveness of the AIEM-DC technique take place on benchmark CT image data set, and the results reported the promising classification performance of the AIEM-DC technique over the recent state-of-the-art approaches.
290	35051468	A comprehensive petrochemical vulnerability index for marine fishes in the Gulf of Mexico.	Oil and gas extraction activities occur across the globe, yet species-specific toxicological information on the biological and ecological impacts of exposure to petrochemicals is lacking for the vast majority of marine species. To help prioritize species for recovery, mitigation, and conservation in light of significant toxicological data gaps, a trait-based petrochemical vulnerability index was developed and applied to the more than 1700 marine fishes present across the entire Gulf of Mexico, including all known bony fishes, sharks, rays and chimaeras. Using life history and other traits related to likelihood of exposure, physiological sensitivity to exposure, and population resiliency, final calculated petrochemical vulnerability scores can be used to provide information on the relative sensitivity, or resilience, of marine fish populations across the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas activities. Based on current knowledge of traits, marine fishes with the highest vulnerability scores primarily occur in areas of high petrochemical activity, are found at or near the surface, and have low reproductive turnover rates and/or highly specialized diet and habitat requirements. Relative population vulnerability scores for marine fishes can be improved with additional toxicokinetic studies, including those that account for the synergistic or additive effect of multiple stressors, as well as increased research on ecological and life history traits, especially for deep living species.

South Brazil's archaeological coastal sites (shellmounds and middens) show a diverse collection of shark faunal remains, some of which belong to species considered rare nowadays for the region. However, shark archaeological remains identification in this region has been historically insufficient and prone to mistakes. This study identified shark fauna and estimated body size (total length) present at two archaeological sites: Rio do Meio (1220-977 Cal B.P.) and Enseada II (4286-3783 Cal B.P.), located in Santa Catarina, South of Brazil. Here, 1600 teeth and 3588 vertebrae were analysed and identified. We showed higher historical shark species richness than previously reported for South Brazil in historical and archaeological studies. In total, we identified at least 15 species of sharks (11 species and four identifications at the genus level). The presence of juvenile shark remains adds to the evidence of pre-colonial fishing impacts in local shark populations. The consistent recovery of adults and juveniles of Carcharias taurus points to a possible nursery area on the mouth of Babitonga bay. The high teeth frequency (43%) of C. taurus suggests the South Brazil coastline was once home to abundant populations of this critically endangered species. Furthermore, we discuss the presence of rare species nowadays, suggesting a possible historical residency for adult populations of Carcharodon carcharias based on the presence of juveniles and young-of-the-year on archaeological sites. The occurrence of Negaprion brevirostris, a tropical species, might have been facilitated by ocean current variations.

Fe-based amorphous coatings with outstanding corrosion resistance are promise for marine applications. However, these coatings encounter a great challenge of biofouling in marine environments. Inspired by the unique micro-nano hierarchical structure of shark skin with excellent antifouling properties, in this paper, we construct a bioinspired Fe-based amorphous coating with killing-resisting dual-effect via proper surface modifications, i.e., the modification with micro-patterned nanostructured Cu
293	35031666	Drivers of variation in occurrence, abundance, and behaviour of sharks on coral reefs.	Quantifying the drivers of population size in reef sharks is critical for the development of appropriate conservation strategies. In north-west Australia, shark populations inhabit coral reefs that border growing centres of human population, industry, and tourism. However, we lack baseline data on reef sharks at large spatial scales (hundreds of km) that might enable managers to assess the status of shark populations in the face of future development in this region. Here, we examined the occurrence, abundance and behaviour of apex (Galeocerdo cuvier, Carcharhinus plumbeus) and reef (C. amblyrhynchos, C. melanopterus, Triaenodon obesus) sharks using > 1200 deployments of baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) across > 500 km of coastline. We found evidence for species-specific influences of habitat and fishing activities on the occurrence (probability of observation), abundance (MaxN) and behaviour of sharks (time of arrival to the stereo-BRUVs and likelihood of feeding). Although the presence of management zoning (No-take areas) made little difference to most species, C. amblyrhynchos were more common further from boat ramps (a proxy of recreational fishing pressure). Time of arrival for all species was also influenced by distance to boat ramp, although patterns varied among species. Our results demonstrate the capacity for behavioural metrics to complement existing measures of occurrence and abundance in assessing the potential impact of human activities on shark populations.
294	35029764	The essential anti-angiogenic strategies in cartilage engineering and osteoarthritic cartilage repair.	In the cartilage matrix, complex interactions occur between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic components, growth factors, and environmental stressors to maintain a proper cartilage phenotype that allows for effective load bearing and force distribution. However, as seen in both degenerative disease and tissue engineering, cartilage can lose its vascular resistance. This vascularization then leads to matrix breakdown, chondrocyte apoptosis, and ossification. Research has shown that articular cartilage inflammation leads to compromised joint function and decreased clinical potential for regeneration. Unfortunately, few articles comprehensively summarize what we have learned from previous investigations. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the factors that stabilize chondrocytes to prevent terminal differentiation and applications of these factors to rescue the cartilage phenotype during cartilage engineering and osteoarthritis treatment. Inhibiting vascularization will allow for enhanced phenotypic stability so that we are able to develop more stable implants for cartilage repair and regeneration.

Prey depletion may contribute to marine predator declines, yet the forage base required to sustain an unfished population of predatory fish at carrying capacity is unknown. We integrated demographic and physiological data within a Bayesian bioenergetic model to estimate annual consumption of a gray reef shark (
297	35023266	Shark teeth can resist ocean acidification.	Ocean acidification can cause dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals in biological structures of many marine organisms, which can be exacerbated by warming. However, it is still unclear whether this also affects organisms that have body parts made of calcium phosphate minerals (e.g. shark teeth), which may also be impacted by the 'corrosive' effect of acidified seawater. Thus, we examined the effect of ocean acidification and warming on the mechanical properties of shark teeth (Port Jackson shark, Heterodontus portusjacksoni), and assessed whether their mineralogical properties can be modified in response to predicted near-future seawater pH (-0.3 units) and temperature (+3°C) changes. We found that warming resulted in the production of more brittle teeth (higher elastic modulus and lower mechanical resilience) that were more vulnerable to physical damage. Yet, when combined with ocean acidification, the durability of teeth increased (i.e. less prone to physical damage due to the production of more elastic teeth) so that they did not differ from those raised under ambient conditions. The teeth were chiefly made of fluorapatite (Ca
298	35023247	Ocean warming alters the distributional range, migratory timing, and spatial protections of an apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier).	Given climate change threats to ecosystems, it is critical to understand the responses of species to warming. This is especially important in the case of apex predators since they exhibit relatively high extinction risk, and changes to their distribution could impact predator-prey interactions that can initiate trophic cascades. Here we used a combined analysis of animal tracking, remotely sensed environmental data, habitat modeling, and capture data to evaluate the effects of climate variability and change on the distributional range and migratory phenology of an ectothermic apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Tiger sharks satellite tracked in the western North Atlantic between 2010 and 2019 revealed significant annual variability in the geographic extent and timing of their migrations to northern latitudes from ocean warming. Specifically, tiger shark migrations have extended farther poleward and arrival times to northern latitudes have occurred earlier in the year during periods with anomalously high sea-surface temperatures. A complementary analysis of nearly 40 years of tiger shark captures in the region revealed decadal-scale changes in the distribution and timing of shark captures in parallel with long-term ocean warming. Specifically, areas of highest catch densities have progressively increased poleward and catches have occurred earlier in the year off the North American shelf. During periods of anomalously high sea-surface temperatures, movements of tracked sharks shifted beyond spatial management zones that had been affording them protection from commercial fishing and bycatch. Taken together, these study results have implications for fisheries management, human-wildlife conflict, and ecosystem functioning.
299	35021231	Evolution of Brain-Expressed Biogenic Amine Receptors into Olfactory Trace Amine-Associated Receptors.	The family of trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) is distantly related to G protein-coupled biogenic aminergic receptors. TAARs are found in the brain as well as in the olfactory epithelium where they detect biogenic amines. However, the functional relationship of receptors from distinct TAAR subfamilies and in different species is still uncertain. Here, we perform a thorough phylogenetic analysis of 702 TAAR-like (TARL) and TAAR sequences from 48 species. We show that a clade of Tarl genes has greatly expanded in lampreys, whereas the other Tarl clade consists of only one or two orthologs in jawed vertebrates and is lost in amniotes. We also identify two small clades of Taar genes in sharks related to the remaining Taar genes in bony vertebrates, which are divided into four major clades. We further identify ligands for 61 orphan TARLs and TAARs from sea lamprey, shark, ray-finned fishes, and mammals, as well as novel ligands for two 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 orthologs, a serotonin receptor subtype closely related to TAARs. Our results reveal a pattern of functional convergence and segregation: TARLs from sea lamprey and bony vertebrate olfactory TAARs underwent independent expansions to function as chemosensory receptors, whereas TARLs from jawed vertebrates retain ancestral response profiles and may have similar functions to TAAR1 in the brain. Overall, our data provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and ligand recognition profiles of TAARs and TARLs.
300	35017072	Study of the immunologic response of marine-derived collagen and gelatin extracts for tissue engineering applications.	The host immunologic response to a specific material is a critical aspect when considering it for clinical implementation. Collagen and gelatin extracted from marine sources have been proposed as biomaterials for tissue engineering applications, but there is a lack of information in the literature about their immunogenicity. In this work, we evaluated the immune response to collagen and/or gelatin from blue shark and codfish, previously extracted and characterized. After endotoxin evaluation, bone marrow-derived macrophages were exposed to the materials and a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated both for protein quantification and gene expression. Then, the impact of those materials in the host was evaluated through peritoneal injection in C57BL/6 mice. The results suggested shark collagen as the less immunogenic material, inducing low expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (encoded by Nos2) and high expression of Arginase 1 (encoded by Arg1). Although shark gelatin appeared to be the material with higher pro-inflammatory expression, it also presents a high expression of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) and Arginase (both markers for M2-like macrophages). When injected in the peritoneal cavity of mice, our materials demonstrated a transient recruitment of neutrophil, being almost non-existent after 24 hours of injection. Based on these findings, the studied collagenous materials can be considered interesting biomaterial candidates for regenerative medicine as they may induce an activation of the M2-like macrophage population, which is involved in suppressing the inflammatory processes promoting tissue remodeling. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Marine-origin biomaterials are emerging in the biomedical arena, namely the ones based in marine-derived collagen/gelatin proposed as cell templates for tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, although the major cause of implant rejection in clinical practice is the host's negative immune response, there is a lack of information in the literature about the immunological impact of these marine collagenous materials. This work aims to contribute with knowledge about the immunologic response to collagen/gelatin extracted from blue shark and codfish skins. The results demonstrated that despite some differences observed, all the materials can induce a macrophage phenotype related with anti-inflammation resolution and then act as immuno-modulators and anti-inflammatory inducible materials.
301	35010894	Alternative Fish Species for Nutritional Management of Children with Fish-FPIES-A Clinical Approach.	In the Mediterranean region, fish is a common cause of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) in children. No laboratory tests specific to FPIES are available, and oral food challenge (OFC) is the gold standard for its diagnosis and testing for achievement of tolerance. Children with FPIES to fish are usually advised to avoid all fish, regardless of the species. Fish are typically classified into bony and cartilaginous, which are phylogenetically distant species and therefore contain less cross-reacting allergens. The protein β-parvalbumin, considered a pan-allergenic, is found in bony fish, while the non-allergenic α-parvalbumin is commonly found in cartilaginous fish. Based on this difference, as a first step in the therapeutic process of children with FPIES caused by a certain fish in the bony fish category (i.e., hake, cod, perch, sardine, gilthead sea bream, red mullet, sole, megrim, sea bass, anchovy, tuna, swordfish, trout, etc.), an OFC to an alternative from the category of cartilaginous fish is suggested (i.e., blue shark, tope shark, dogfish, monkfish, skate, and ray) and vice versa. Regarding the increased mercury content in some sharks and other large species, the maximum limit imposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for weekly mercury intake must be considered. An algorithm for the management of fish-FPIES, including alternative fish species, is proposed.
302	35008452	Molecular Weight Analysis of Blue Shark (Prionace glauca) Collagen Hydrolysates by GPC-LS; Effect of High Molecular Weight Hydrolysates on Fibroblast Cultures: mRNA Collagen Type I Expression and Synthesis.	High molecular weight (Mw) collagen hydrolysates have been demonstrated to produce a higher synthesis of collagen type I mRNA. Mw determination is a key factor maximizing the effect of collagen hydrolysates on collagen type I synthesis by fibroblasts. This work aimed to achieve a high average Mw in Blue Shark Collagen Hydrolysate, studying different hydrolysis parameters by GPC-LS analysis and testing its effect on mRNA Type I collagen expression. Analysis revealed differences in blue shark collagen hydrolysates Mw depending on hydrolysis conditions. Papain leads to obtaining a significantly higher Mw hydrolysate than Alcalase at different times of hydrolysis and at different enzyme/substrate ratios. Besides, the time of the hydrolysis factor is more determinant than the enzyme/substrate ratio factor for obtaining a higher or lower hydrolysate Mw when using Papain as the enzyme. Contrary, Alcalase hydrolysates resulted in similar Mw with no significant differences between different conditions of hydrolysis assayed. Blue shark collagen hydrolysate showing the highest Mw showed neither cytotoxic nor proliferation effect on fibroblast cell culture. Besides, it exhibited an increasing effect on both mRNA expression and pro-collagen I production.
303	35008051	Seasonal Dynamics of Mosquito-Borne Viruses in the Southwestern Florida Everglades, 2016, 2017.	Mosquitoes were collected for 12 consecutive months beginning June 2016, from 11 locations in the Florida Everglades, Collier County, and tested for viruses by isolation in Vero cells and subsequent identification. One species complex and 31 species of mosquitoes were identified from 668,809 specimens. Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus comprised 72.2% of the collection. Other notable species were Anopheles crucians complex, Culex nigripalpus, Cx. erraticus, and Cx. cedecei. Seven species of virus were identified from 110 isolations: Everglades, Gumbo Limbo, Mahogany Hammock, Pahayokee, Shark River, Tensaw, and West Nile viruses. Everglades, West Nile, Tensaw, and Mahogany Hammock viruses were most frequently isolated. Largest numbers of viruses were identified from Cx. cedecei, Cx. nigripalpus, and An. crucians complex. Five species of virus were isolated from Cx. cedecei. Viruses were isolated from mangrove, cypress swamp, hardwood hammock, and sawgrass habitats. West Nile virus was isolated August through October when Cx. nigripalpus was most abundant. Everglades virus was the most frequently isolated virus from nine species of mosquitoes collected from June through August. Tensaw virus was isolated primarily from Anopheles species. Isolations were made in July, August, January, February, and April, suggesting that this virus may be present in host-seeking mosquitoes throughout the year. Mahogany Hammock, Shark River, Gumbo Limbo, and Pahayokee viruses were isolated primarily from Cx. cedecei from June through December. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to document that seven pools of Cx. cedecei were infected with two arboviruses. As communities expand into the Everglades, more humans will become exposed to arboviruses.
304	35003210	Mineralized Cartilage and Bone-Like Tissues in Chondrichthyans Offer Potential Insights Into the Evolution and Development of Mineralized Tissues in the Vertebrate Endoskeleton.	The impregnation of biominerals into the extracellular matrix of living organisms, a process termed biomineralization, gives rise to diverse mineralized (or calcified) tissues in vertebrates. Preservation of mineralized tissues in the fossil record has provided insights into the evolutionary history of vertebrates and their skeletons. However, current understanding of the vertebrate skeleton and of the processes underlying its formation is biased towards biomedical models such as the tetrapods mouse and chick. Chondrichthyans (sharks, skates, rays, and chimaeras) and osteichthyans are the only vertebrate groups with extant (living) representatives that have a mineralized skeleton, but the basal phylogenetic position of chondrichthyans could potentially offer unique insights into skeletal evolution. For example, bone is a vertebrate novelty, but the internal supporting skeleton (endoskeleton) of extant chondrichthyans is commonly described as lacking bone. The molecular and developmental basis for this assertion is yet to be tested. Subperichondral tissues in the endoskeleton of some chondrichthyans display mineralization patterns and histological and molecular features of bone, thereby challenging the notion that extant chondrichthyans lack endoskeletal bone. Additionally, the chondrichthyan endoskeleton demonstrates some unique features and others that are potentially homologous with other vertebrates, including a polygonal mineralization pattern, a trabecular mineralization pattern, and an unconstricted perichordal sheath. Because of the basal phylogenetic position of chondrichthyans among all other extant vertebrates with a mineralized skeleton, developmental and molecular studies of chondrichthyans are critical to flesh out the evolution of vertebrate skeletal tissues, but only a handful of such studies have been carried out to date. This review discusses morphological and molecular features of chondrichthyan endoskeletal tissues and cell types, ultimately emphasizing how comparative embryology and transcriptomics can reveal homology of mineralized skeletal tissues (and their cell types) between chondrichthyans and other vertebrates.
306	35001329	Two New Cestode Species of Phoreiobothrium (Onchoproteocephalidea) from Two Carcharhinid Sharks of the Persian Gulf, with the First Report of Variation in Distribution of Vitelline Follicles of the Genus.	"PURPOSE: The aim of this work was the morphological study of the onchoproteocephalidean cestodes from two shark species of the Persian Gulf.
METHODS: Several specimens of Rhizoprionodon oligolinx, as well as of Carcharhinus dussumieri, were collected from the Persian Gulf, and the isolated cestodes from them were studied morphologically by light and scanning electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Phoreiobothrium sarahae n. sp. and Phoreiobothrium iraniense n. sp. were isolated, respectively, from Rhizoprionodon oligolinx Springer and Carcharhinus dussumieri (Müller & Henle). Both species are quite distinct from their congeners, except for P. sorrahcola Masoumi Ganjgah & Haseli, 2020, in the distribution of the vitelline follicles (i.e., having more than two columns of vitelline follicles in each lateral band in the proglottids) and are distinguished from each other based on measurement, e.g., by the length of the cephalic peduncle, the width of the scolex at the level of hooks, and some measures related to the hooks. Phoreiobothrium iraniense n. sp. most closely resembles P. sorrahcola, earlier described from C. sorrah (Müller & Henle) from the Persian Gulf, with which it has an extensive overlap in the ranges of measurements and morphology. Nonetheless, it differs from P. sorrahcola in the length of the cephalic peduncle and possessing, rather than lacking, the gladiate spinitriches on the proximal bothridial surfaces.
CONCLUSION: Along with the description of the two new species increasing the number of members of the genus in the Iranian coastal waters from three to five, for the first time a variation in distribution of the vitelline follicles is reported for Phoreiobothrium in this paper."
307	34999244	Shark centra microanatomy and mineral density variation studied with laboratory microComputed Tomography.	Centra of shark vertebrae from three species of Lamniformes (Alopias vulpinus, Carcharodon carcharias and Isurus oxyrinchus) and three species of Carcharhiniformes (Carcharhinus plumbeus, Carcharhinus obscurus and Prionace glauca) were imaged with laboratory microcomputed Tomography (microCT) using volume element (voxel) sizes between 16 and 24 µm. Linear attenuation coefficients were the same in the corpus calcarea (hour-glass-shaped cone) and intermedialia of the lamniforms but were smaller in the intermedialia than in the corpus calcarea of the carcharhiniforms. All centra contained growth bands which were visible as small changes in linear attenuation coefficient. In all six cases, the cross-sections of the cones were close to circular, and the cone angles matched those reported in the literature. Cartilage canals were a prominent structure in the intermedialia of all species, 3D renderings of centra of C. obscurus and I. oxyrinchus diameters showed these canals ran radially outward from the cone walls, and canal diameters were consistent with the limited numerical values in the literature. Somewhat higher calcification levels around the periphery of cartilage canals and of outer surfaces of the intermedialia and corpus calcerea suggest microstructural variation exists at scale below that which can be resolved in the present data sets.
308	34997380	Study of the glial cytoarchitecture of the developing olfactory bulb of a shark using immunochemical markers of radial glia.	During development of the olfactory bulb (OB), glial cells play key roles in axonal guiding/targeting, glomerular formation and synaptic plasticity. Studies in mammals have shown that radial glial cells and peripheral olfactory glia (olfactory ensheathing cells, OECs) are involved in the development of the OB. Most studies about the OB glia were carried out in mammals, but data are lacking in most non-mammalian vertebrates. In the present work, we studied the development of the OB glial system in the cartilaginous fish Scyliorhinus canicula (catshark) using antibodies against glial markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), and glutamine synthase (GS). These glial markers were expressed in cells with radial morphology lining the OB ventricle of embryos and this expression continues in ependymal cells (tanycytes) in early juveniles. Astrocyte-like cells were also observed in the granular layer and surrounding glomeruli. Numerous GS-positive cells were present in the primary olfactory pathway of embryos. In the developmental stages analysed, the olfactory nerve layer and the glomerular layer were the regions with higher GFAP, BLBP and GS immuno-reactivity. In addition, numerous BLBP-expressing cells (a marker of mammalian OECs) showing proliferative activity were present in the olfactory nerve layer. Our findings suggest that glial cells of peripheral and central origin coexist in the OB of catshark embryos and early juveniles. These results open the path for future studies about the differential roles of glial cells in the catshark OB during embryonic development and in adulthood.
309	34995885	Pollutant Pb burden in Mediterranean Centroscymnus coelolepis deep-sea sharks.	We report lead (Pb) analyses in juvenile (n = 37; mean length = 24.7 ± 2.3 cm) and adult (n = 16; mean length = 52.3 ± 9.3 cm) Centroscymnus coelolepis Mediterranean deep-sea sharks that are compared to Pb content in bathy-demersal, pelagic and shallow coastal sharks. Median Pb concentrations of C. coelolepis muscle (0.009-0.056 wet ppm) and liver (0.023-0.061 wet ppm) are among the lowest encountered in shark records. Stable Pb isotope imprints in adult C. coelolepis muscles highlight that most of Pb in C. coelolepis is from human origin. Lead isotopes reveal the persistence of gasoline Pb emitted in the 1970s in low-turnover adult shark's muscle while associated liver imprints are in equilibrium with recent pollutant Pb signatures suggesting an efficient pollutant Pb turnover metabolism. The comparison of Pb distribution between adult and juvenile cohorts suggests the role of dietary exposure and possible maternal offloading of Pb during gestation, likely associated to vitellogenesis in this aplacental viviparous deep-sea shark.
310	34991668	M1-like tumor-associated macrophages cascade a mesenchymal/stem-like phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma via the IL6/Stat3/THBS1 feedback loop.	"BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have a leading position in the tumor microenvironment. Previously, we have demonstrated that M1-like TAMs activated by exosome-transferred THBS1 promote malignant migration in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, the functional roles and associated molecular mechanisms of the activated M1-like TAMs need to be further clarified in OSCC.
METHODS: Conditioned Media (CM) were harvested from the exosome activated M1-like TAMs. We measured the malignant behaviors of OSCC under the treatment of CM from M1-like TAMs by performing colony forming assays, invasion assays, wound-healing assays, spheroid forming assays and in vivo xenograft experiments. The underlying mechanisms were investigated by RNA-seq, cytokines analysis, intracellular signaling pathway analysis, ChIP assays, bioinformatics analysis and validation.
RESULTS: M1-like TAMs significantly promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, and induced the cancer-stem like cells (CSCs) by upregulating the expression of MME and MMP14 in OSCC cells. Cytokine analysis revealed a shark increase of IL6 secretion from M1-like TAMs. Blocking IL6 in the CM from M1-like TAMs could significantly weaken its effects on the colony forming, invasion, migration, microsphere forming and xenograft forming abilities of OSCC cells. Cellular signaling assays indicated the activation of Jak/Stat3 pathway in the OSCC cells treated by the CM from M1-like TAMs. Blocking the activation of the Jak/Stat3 pathway could significantly weaken the effects of M1-like TAMs on the colony forming, invasion, migration, microsphere forming and xenograft forming abilities of OSCC cells. Further RNA-seq analysis and bioinformatics analysis revealed an increased expression of THBS1 in the OSCC cells treated by M1-like TAMs. Bioinformatics prediction and ChIP assays revealed the activation of Stat3 by CM from M1-like TAMs could directly promote the transcription of THBS1 in OSCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that M1-like TAMs could cascade a mesenchymal/stem-like phenotype of OSCC via the IL6/Stat3/THBS1 feedback loop. A better understanding on the functional roles and associated molecular mechanisms of M1-like TAMs might facilitate the development of novel therapies for supplementing the current treatment strategies for OSCC patients."
311	34991430	Endoscopic ultrasound with combined fine needle aspiration plus biopsy improves diagnostic yield in solid pancreatic masses.	"GOALS: Our aim was to compare the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) versus combined fine needle aspiration and fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNA + FNB) in the evaluation of solid pancreatic masses (SPMs).
BACKGROUND: EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB are established methods to diagnose SPMs. No studies have evaluated the efficacy of combination of both (EUS-FNA + FNB). Our senior author (MRS) hypothesized that combining the two techniques by using a single FNB needle improves diagnostic yield and started combination technique in October 2016.
STUDY: Patients who underwent EUS for SPMs by MRS during January 2014-September 2019 were included. They were divided into the EUS-FNA group and EUS-FNA + FNB group. EUS-FNA was performed using a 22 or 25 gauge Expect Slimline needle (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) and EUS-FNA + FNB was performed using a single 22 or 25 gauge Shark-core needle (Medtronics, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Our primary outcome was to compare the diagnostic yield in the two groups.
RESULTS: Among 105 patients included, 58 were in the EUS-FNA group and 47 were in the EUS-FNA + FNB group. EUS-FNA + FNB group had significantly higher diagnostic yield and required fewer needle passes compared to EUS-FNA group, 95.7% vs. 77.6%, 
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that combined EUS-FNA + FNB had higher diagnostic yield compared to EUS-FNA in SPMs along with less number of needle passes and needles required. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and cost-effectiveness of this strategy."

"The sampling of 22 specimens of Rhizoprionodon oligolinx Springer from the Persian Gulf made possible the description of three new species of Anthobothrium van Beneden, 1850. Anthobothrium parimae sp. nov. is different from its congeners, except for A. altavelae Neifar, Euzet and Ben Hassine, 2002, A. lyndoni Ruhnke and Caira, 2009, and A. lesteri Williams, Burt and Caira, 2004, in the total length. It differs from A. altavelae in the number of the proglottids; from A. lyndoni in the length of the mature proglottids; and from A. lesteri Williams, Burt and Caira, 2004 in possessing one hemicircular band, rather than two circular bands, of musculature in its bothridia. The other two new species, being the smallest in size within the genus, most closely resemble each other but differ in the position of the genital pore in the proglottid, the number of post-vaginal testes, the number of the ventral and dorsal columns of vitelline follicles in each lateral band, and the distribution of the gladiate spinitriches on the strobila. These three new species are the only ""tetraphyllidean"" species reported to date from the southern waters of Iran. In addition, for the first time, more than two congeners belonging to Anthobothrium are reported from the same host species sympatrically and simultaneously. The morphological variation within this genus is also discussed."
313	34988371	Dermal Denticle Diversity in Sharks: Novel Patterns on the Interbranchial Skin.	"Shark skin is covered in dermal denticles-tooth-like structures consisting of enameloid, dentine, and a central pulp cavity. Previous studies have demonstrated differences in denticle morphology both among species and across different body regions within a species, including one report of extreme morphological variation within a 1 cm distance on the skin covering the branchial pouches, a region termed ""interbranchial skin."" We used gel-based profilometry, histology, and scanning electron microscopy to quantify differences in denticle morphology and surface topography of interbranchial skin denticles among 13 species of sharks to better understand the surface structure of this region. We show that (1) interbranchial skin denticles differ across shark species, and (2) denticles on the leading edge of the skin covering each gill pouch have different morphology and surface topography compared with denticles on the trailing edge. Across all species studied, there were significant differences in denticle length ("
314	34986563	Foraging plasticity diversifies mercury exposure sources and bioaccumulation patterns in the world's largest predatory fish.	Large marine predators exhibit high concentrations of mercury (Hg) as neurotoxic methylmercury, and the potential impacts of global change on Hg contamination in these species remain highly debated. Current contaminant model predictions do not account for intraspecific variability in Hg exposure and may fail to reflect the diversity of future Hg levels among conspecific populations or individuals, especially for top predators displaying a wide range of ecological traits. Here, we used Hg isotopic compositions to show that Hg exposure sources varied significantly between and within three populations of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) with contrasting ecology: the north-eastern Pacific, eastern Australasian, and south-western Australasian populations. Through Δ
315	34981899	Mode of uterine milk secretion in the white shark.	"Examination of the uterus of a dead female white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), which contained the earliest known white shark embryos, revealed that the uterine wall produces lipid-rich secretion (histotroph or ""uterine milk"") for embryonic nutrition. Uterine tissue was processed for light and electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical techniques to identify its secretory mechanism. Our results indicate that the white shark uterus secretes lipids via holocrine secretion. This type of secretion is characterized by the release of large lipid droplets accumulated in the epithelial cells into the uterine lumen through cell disintegration. The secretory epithelium of the uterus is stratified, and new surface epithelial cells are continuously supplied from deeper epithelial layers to replace the dead secretory cells at the surface. This vertical replacement possibly facilitates the active renewal of the surface epithelium, which is necessary for maintaining holocrine secretory mechanisms. These secretory mechanisms are different from those of myliobatiform stingrays, another elasmobranch taxon that exhibits lipid histotrophy. This may reflect the different origins of lipid histotrophy between these taxa."
316	34960850	Utilization of Melt Fracture Phenomenon for the Preparation of Shark Skin Structured Hydrophobic Film.	With the application of biomimetic shark skin microstructures with hydrophobicity in microfluidics, sensors and self-cleaning materials, microstructure processing methods are increasing. The preparation process has higher requirements for processing cost and efficiency. In this paper, linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) hydrophobic films were prepared with the help of melt fracture phenomenon. The equipment is a self-made single screw extruder. By adjusting the process parameters, the biomimetic shark skin structured LLDPE films with good hydrophobic property can be obtained. The surface microstructure shape of the product is related to kinds of additive, die temperature and screw speed. When AC5 was selected as an additive, the optimal processing parameter was found to be 160 °C die temperature and 80 r/min screw speed. A contact angle of 133° was obtained in this situation. In addition, the influences of die temperature and screw speed on the size of shark skin structure were also systematically investigated in this paper. It was found that the microstructure surface with hierarchical roughness had a better hydrophobic property.

Pelagic sharks are vulnerable to overfishing due to slow growth rates, late-at-maturity and low fecundity, 90% of which are Near Threatened with an elevated risk of extinction according to IUCN Red List Criteria. Trace elements can be accumulated by marine predators and may have detrimental effects on population dynamics. In this study, we analyzed the concentrations of 11 trace elements (Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Mn, Se, Co, Hg, Cd, Pb, and As) in muscle and liver tissues of 10 pregnant pelagic thresher sharks (

"None: Marine plastic abundance has increased over the past 60 years and microplastics (< 5 mm) constitute a primary component of such litter. Filter-feeding megafauna, such as the whale shark, might be particularly affected by microplastic pollution as their feeding mode requires filtration of up to thousands of cubic meters of water. In addition, the habitat range of whale sharks intersects with several recognized microplastic pollution hotspots, among which is the Coral Triangle. Direct evidence for microplastic ingestion in whale sharks however, has not yet been presented. Here we show that whale shark scat collected in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019 contained a mean of 2.8 microplastics g

324	34932875	Insights into genetic variation and demographic history of sharpnose rays: examinations of three species of Telatrygon (Elasmobranchii, Dasyatidae) from the Indo-West Pacific.	Coastal and demersal chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, and skates) are expected to exhibit high levels of genetic differentiation in areas of complex geomorphology. Population genetic studies investigating the extent to which demographic history shapes the genetic structure of these fishes are rare. Here, we combined mitochondrial DNA (Cytb and ND2) and 8 nuclear microsatellite loci from 244 individuals to examine the population genetic structure and demographic history of the 3 Indo-West Pacific species of sharpnose rays (Telatrygon zugei, Telatrygon biasa, and Trygon crozieri). High levels of genetic variation both within and between species were identified. Phylogenetic analysis partitioned haplotypes into 2 lineages supporting divergence of T. zugei from T. crozieri and T. biasa during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, microsatellite-based clustering analyses identified 4 genetic groups (i.e. T. zugei from Japan, T. zugei from coastal China, T. biasa from Gulf of Thailand, and T. crozieri from the Andaman Sea). Measurements of genetic differentiation also support these 4 groups. Additionally, Pleistocene demographic expansions were examined in all genetic groups. The climate oscillations and current hydrologic cycles in the Indo-West Pacific appear to coincide with the hypothesis regarding speciation and the observed demographic history trends of the sharpnose rays. Considering the species group has, until recently, been thought to be one species, these results are critical for defining management units and guiding conservation efforts to preserve stingray biodiversity.
325	34931705	Of three sharks and one chimaera: varied habitat preferences across a latitudinal range revealed by coastal and offshore surveys.	Using national and international research survey data and applying a combination of models and mapping tools, this study revealed temperature and depth as the crucial environmental drivers of both the distribution and the abundance of four benthopelagic chondrichthyans inhabiting Norwegian and Icelandic waters: rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa), velvet-belly lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax), blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and spurdog (Squalus acanthias). C. monstrosa and E. spinax seem to prefer similar spatial and ecological habitats, that is deep and cold waters. In contrast, G. melastomus and S. acanthias both prefer similar ecological habitats, that is warmer and shallower waters; nonetheless, they exhibit a different spatial distribution pattern. The species' varied habitat and spatial preferences may lead to different levels of exposure to fishing activities and associated by-catch risks. Findings of the species' spatial distributions and their driving forces are expected to inform the sustainable management of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit.
326	34916516	Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by shark variable new antigen receptors elucidated through X-ray crystallography.	Single-domain Variable New Antigen Receptors (VNARs) from the immune system of sharks are the smallest naturally occurring binding domains found in nature. Possessing flexible paratopes that can recognize protein motifs inaccessible to classical antibodies, VNARs have yet to be exploited for the development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics. Here, we detail the identification of a series of VNARs from a VNAR phage display library screened against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The ability of the VNARs to neutralize pseudotype and authentic live SARS-CoV-2 virus rivalled or exceeded that of full-length immunoglobulins and other single-domain antibodies. Crystallographic analysis of two VNARs found that they recognized separate epitopes on the RBD and had distinctly different mechanisms of virus neutralization unique to VNARs. Structural and biochemical data suggest that VNARs would be effective therapeutic agents against emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including the Delta variant, and coronaviruses across multiple phylogenetic lineages. This study highlights the utility of VNARs as effective therapeutics against coronaviruses and may serve as a critical milestone for nearing a paradigm shift of the greater biologic landscape.

The broadnose sevengill shark, Notorynchus cepedianus (Péron, 1807), is a large marine top predator in temperate coastal ecosystems. Some aspects of its life history have been determined, but its growth pattern is yet to be fully understood. The authors used a multi-modelling approach and a sensitivity test to estimate growth parameters from young-of-year (YOY) length data collected off San Antonio Cape (SAC), Argentina, a critical habitat in the Southwest Atlantic Coastal Zone (SACZ).

331	34882682	Conservation of A-to-I RNA editing in bowhead whale and pig.	RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process in which nucleotide changes are introduced into an RNA sequence, many of which can contribute to proteomic sequence variation. The most common type of RNA editing, contributing to nearly 99% of all editing events in RNA, is A-to-I (adenosine-to-inosine) editing mediated by double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes. A-to-I editing at 'recoding' sites results in non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding sequences. Here, we present studies of the conservation of A-to-I editing in selected mRNAs between pigs, bowhead whales, humans and two shark species. All examined mRNAs-NEIL1, COG3, GRIA2, FLNA, FLNB, IGFBP7, AZIN1, BLCAP, GLI1, SON, HTR2C and ADAR2 -showed conservation of A-to-I editing of recoding sites. In addition, novel editing sites were identified in NEIL1 and GLI1 in bowhead whales. The A-to-I editing site of human NEIL1 in position 242 was conserved in the bowhead and porcine homologues. A novel editing site was discovered in Tyr244. Differential editing was detected at the two adenosines in the NEIL1 242 codon in both pig and bowhead NEIL1 mRNAs in various tissues and organs. No conservation of editing of KCNB1 and EEF1A mRNAs was seen in bowhead whales. In silico analyses revealed conservation of five adenosines in ADAR2, some of which are subject to A-to-I editing in bowheads and pigs, and conservation of a regulatory sequence in GRIA2 mRNA that is responsible for recognition of the ADAR editing enzyme.

Cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays, and chimeras) are the most phylogenetically distant lineage relative to mammals in which somatically rearranging immunoglobulins (Igs or antibodies) have also been found. Alongside their conventional (heavy-light chain) isotypes, IgM and IgW, sharks produce the novel isotype, IgNAR, a heavy-chain homodimer. Naturally lacking light chains, antigen binding is mediated by two highly soluble and independently functioning variable domains, or VNARs, each having a molecular weight of approximately 12 kDa. The small size, high affinity for antigen, and extreme structural stability of single-domain VNARs make them an emerging prospect for use in therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications. In this chapter, we detail the immunization protocol we use to raise an antigen-specific IgNAR response in the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum), the subsequent cloning of the variable domains from this isotype, and the selection of antigen-specific VNARs by phage display.

The present study describes for the first time the community composition and functional potential of the microbial mats found in the supratidal, gypsum-rich and hypersaline region of Blue Holes, Shark Bay. This was achieved via high-throughput metagenomic sequencing of total mat community DNA and complementary analyses using hyperspectral confocal microscopy. Mat communities were dominated by Proteobacteria (29%), followed by Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group (11%) and Planctomycetes (10%). These mats were found to also harbour a diverse community of potentially novel microorganisms, including members from the DPANN, Asgard archaea and candidate phyla radiation, with highest diversity found in the lower regions (∼14-20 mm depth) of the mat. In addition to pathways for major metabolic cycles, a range of putative rhodopsins with previously uncharacterized motifs and functions were identified along with heliorhodopsins and putative schizorhodopsins. Critical microbial interactions were also inferred, and from 117 medium- to high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes, viral defence mechanisms (CRISPR, BREX and DISARM), elemental transport, osmoprotection, heavy metal resistance and UV resistance were also detected. These analyses have provided a greater understanding of these distinct mat systems in Shark Bay, including key insights into adaptive responses and proposing that photoheterotrophy may be an important lifestyle in Blue Holes.
340	34856347	Aquaporin (AQP) channels in the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias II: Localization of AQP3, AQP4 and AQP15 in the kidney.	Three aquaporin water channel proteins, AQP3, AQP4 and AQP15 were localized to cells within the kidney of the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, using an immunohistochemical approach. Dogfish kidney has two zones, the bundle zone (including five nephron segment bundles) and the sinus zone (with two major loops). In order to discriminate between the two loops, the cilia occurring in the first proximal/intermediate loop were labeled with two antibodies including an anti-acetylated tubulin antibody. The second late distal tubule loop (LDT) was identified, as the nephron in that region has no luminal cilia. Strong staining of the rabbit anti-dogfish AQP3, AQP4 (AQP4/2) or AQP15 polyclonal antibodies localized to LDT tubules. These antibodies were further co-stained with a mouse anti-Na
341	34856346	Aquaporin (AQP) channels in the spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias I: Characterization of AQP3 and AQP15 function and expression, and localization of the proteins in gill and spiral valve intestine.	Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) for two aquaporin water channel genes (AQP3 and AQP15) were amplified cloned and sequenced to initiate this study. Northern blot analysis was carried out to confirm the mRNA sizes of these AQP genes with AQP3 mRNA bands exhibiting sizes of 1.2 and 1.6 k bases and AQP15 had a mRNA band of 2.1 k bases. Northern blot analysis was also performed on kidney and esophagus total RNA samples from fish acclimated to 75%, 100% or 120% seawater (SW). The level of AQP15 mRNA expression was shown to significantly decrease following salinity acclimation from 100 to 120% SW. An opposite but non-significantly different trend was observed for AQP3 mRNA levels. Full length cDNAs were then used to generate AQP3 and AQP15 mRNAs for microinjection into Xenopus oocytes. Both AQP3- and AQP15- microinjected oocytes exhibited significantly elevated apparent water permeability compared to control oocytes at neutral pH. The apparent water permeability was mercury-inhibitable, significantly so in the case of AQP3. AQP3 microinjected oocytes showed pH sensitivity in their apparent water permeability, showing a lack of permeability at acidic pH values. The Carboxyl-terminal derived amino acid sequences of AQP3 and AQP15 were used to generate rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. Western blots with the antibodies showed a band of 31.3 kDa for AQP3 in the kidney, with minor bands at 26, 24 and 21 kDa. For AQP15 a band of 26 kDa was seen in gill and kidney. Fainter bands at 28 and 24 kDa were also seen in the kidney. There was also some higher molecular weight banding. None of the bands were seen when the antibodies were pre- blocked with their peptide antigens. Immunohistochemical localization studies were also performed in the gill and spiral valve intestine. In the gill, AQP15 antibody staining was seen sporadically in the membranes of surface epithelial cells of the secondary lamellae. Tyramide amplification of signals was employed in the spiral valve intestine. Tyramide-amplified AQP3 antibody staining was observed in the basal membrane of the invaginated epithelial cell layer of secondary intestinal folds in luminal surface of either the side wall of the spiral valve intestine or in internal valve tissue 'flaps'. For the AQP15 antibody, tyramide-amplified staining was instead found on the apical and to a lesser extent the lateral membranes of the same invaginated epithelial cell layer. The localization of AQP3 and AQP15 in the spiral valve intestine suggests that a trans-cellular water absorption pathway may exist in this tissue.
342	34853331	Branching patterns of the afferent branchial arteries and their phylogenetic significance in rays (Batoidea).	Rays of the superorder Batoidea comprise the most diverse group of chondrichthyans in terms of valid species and morphological disparity. Up to the present little agreement is observed in studies based on morphological and molecular data focused on uncovering the interrelationships within Batoidea. Morphology-based phylogenies of batoids have not included characters related to the afferent branchial arteries, and little is known about the variation in this anatomical complex in rays. Herein, representatives of 32 genera from 19 families currently recognized of rays were examined as well as some shark taxa. Seven new characters are proposed and tested in two different analyses, one on their own and in the other they were added to the morphological data matrix of the most recent analysis of interrelationships within Batoidea. The arrangement of afferent branchial arteries differs mainly among orders and families of batoids. The absence of a common trunk from which the three posteriormost afferent arteries branch is interpreted as a synapomorphy for Myliobatiformes and the presence of a coronary cranial artery as an autapomorphy for Mobula hypostoma. A close spatial relationship between the second and third afferent arteries within the common branch from the ventral aorta is proposed as a synapomorphy for Rajiformes with a secondary modification in Sympterygia. Data about patterns in afferent branchial arteries in additional taxa such as Squaliformes and Chimaeriformes are needed to better understand the evolution of this character complex among chondrichthyans.

344	34844362	Ecophysiological effects of mercury bioaccumulation and biochemical stress in the deep-water mesopredator Etmopterus spinax (Elasmobranchii; Etmopteridae).	Mercury (Hg) is a non-essential metal that can have toxic effects on the fitness of organisms and tends to bioaccumulate with age and to biomagnify in higher trophic levels. Few studies have assessed oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in deep-water sharks. This study evaluated early ontogenetic changes and physiological effects (antioxidant defences, oxidative damage, aerobic metabolism and neurotransmission functions) of Hg accumulation in the white muscle and brain tissues of the velvet belly lantern shark Etmopterus spinax from the southern Iberian coast (NE Atlantic). Results suggested that the low mercury concentrations observed may induce acute effects in E. spinax before they reach sexual maturity. We found different Hg concentrations in E. spinax: [Hg] males > [Hg] females; [Hg] muscle > [Hg] brain. Females appeared to have higher redox capability translated into higher activities and levels of antioxidant defences than males. However, higher levels of oxidative damage were also observed in females. Whilst the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown, these results suggest differences in mercury accumulation between tissues and sex, and potentially deleterious effects on oxidative stress status and neurophysiology of E. spinax, potentially impairing swimming performance and reproduction, which could subsequently impact on the health of both individuals and population.
345	34836978	First tracking of the oceanic spawning migrations of Australasian short-finned eels (Anguilla australis).	Anguillid eel populations have declined dramatically over the last 50 years in many regions of the world, and numerous species are now under threat. A critical life-history phase is migration from freshwater to distant oceans, culminating in a single life-time spawning event. For many anguillids, especially those in the southern hemisphere, mystery still shrouds their oceanic spawning migrations. We investigated the oceanic spawning migrations of the Australasian short-finned eel (Anguilla australis) using pop-up satellite archival tags. Eels were collected from river estuaries (38° S, 142° E) in south-eastern temperate Australia. In 2019, 16 eels were tracked for up to about 5 months, ~ 2620 km from release, and as far north as the tropical Coral Sea (22° S, 155° E) off the north-east coast of Australia. Eels from southern Australia appeared to access deep water off the Australian coast via two main routes: (i) directly east via Bass Strait, or (ii) south-east around Tasmania, which is the shortest route to deep water. Tagged eels exhibited strong diel vertical migrations, alternating between the warm euphotic zone (~ 100-300 m, 15-20 °C) at night and the mesopelagic zone (~ 700-900 m, 6-8 °C) during the day. Marine predators, probably lamnid sharks, tuna, or marine mammals, ended many eel migrations (at least ~ 30%), largely before the eels had left the Australian continental shelf. The long and risky marine migrations of Australasian eels highlight the need for better information on the processes contributing to eel mortality throughout the life cycle, including the impacts of future changes to oceanic currents, predator abundance and direct anthropogenic disturbances.
346	34827127	Environmental DNA (eDNA) Metabarcoding in the Fish Market and Nearby Seafood Restaurants in Taiwan Reveals the Underestimation of Fish Species Diversity in Seafood.	Seafood, especially the traditional one in Taiwan, is rarely sourced from a fixed species and routinely from similar species depending on their availability. Hence, the species composition of seafood can be complicated. While a DNA-based approach has been routinely utilized for species identification, a large scale of seafood identification in fish markets and restaurants could be challenging (e.g., elevated cost and time-consuming only for a limited number of species identification). In the present study, we aimed to identify the majority of fish species potentially consumed in fish markets and nearby seafood restaurants using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Four eDNA samplings from a local fish market and nearby seafood restaurants were conducted using Sterivex cartridges. Nineteen universal primers previously validated for fish species identification were utilized to amplify the fragments of mitochondrial DNA (12S, COI, ND5) of species in eDNA samples and sequenced with NovaSeq 6000 sequencing. A total of 153 fish species have been identified based on 417 fish related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated from 50,534,995 reads. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) further showed the differences in fish species between the sampling times and sampling sites. Of these fish species, 22 chondrichthyan fish, 14 Anguilliformes species, and 15 Serranidae species were respectively associated with smoked sharks, braised moray eels, and grouper fish soups. To our best knowledge, this work represents the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of a large scale of seafood identification using eDNA metabarcoding approach. Our findings also imply the species diversity in traditional seafood might be seriously underestimated and crucial for the conservation and management of marine resources.
347	34824827	Grow fast, die young: Does compensatory growth reduce survival of juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) in the western Gulf of Mexico?	Effective conservation and management necessitate an understanding of the ecological mechanisms that shape species life histories in order to predict how variability in natural and anthropogenic impacts will alter growth rates, recruitment, and survival. Among these mechanisms, the interaction between parturition timing and prey availability frequently influences offspring success, particularly when postnatal care is absent. Here, we assess how parturition timing and nursery conditions, including prey abundance and environmental conditions, influence the growth and potential survival of blacktip sharks (
348	34824811	Defining distribution and habitat use of west-central Florida's coastal sharks through a research and education program.	"Identifying critical habitat for highly mobile species such as sharks is difficult, but essential for effective management and conservation. In regions where baseline data are lacking, non-traditional data sources have the potential to increase observational capacity for species distribution and habitat studies. In this study, a research and education organization conducted a 5-year (2013-2018) survey of shark populations in the coastal waters of west-central Florida, an area where a diverse shark assemblage has been observed but no formal population analyses have been conducted. The objectives of this study were to use boosted regression tree (BRT) modeling to quantify environmental factors impacting the distribution of the shark assemblage, create species distribution maps from the model outputs, and identify spatially explicit hot spots of high shark abundance. A total of 1036 sharks were captured, encompassing eleven species. Abundance hot spots for four species and for immature sharks (collectively) were most often located in areas designated as ""No Internal Combustion Engine"" zones and seagrass bottom cover, suggesting these environments may be fostering more diverse and abundant populations. The BRT models were fitted for immature sharks and five species where "
349	34820633	Cookiecutter Shark-Related Injuries: A New Threat to Swimming Across the Ka'iwi Channel.	In a 5-month period in 2019, 3 long-distance swimmers sustained cookiecutter shark-related injuries while attempting to cross the Ka'iwi Channel between the Hawaiian Islands of O'ahu and Moloka'i. This report is the first case series of cookiecutter shark bites on live humans. A retrospective review of the State of Hawai'i Division of Aquatic Resources Shark Incidents List was conducted between March 1, 2019, and July 31, 2019. Trauma registry data and medical records were reviewed in patients treated for cookiecutter shark bites at The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawai'i. All 3 patients sustained nonfatal cookiecutter shark bite circular wounds measuring between 8-13 cm in diameter. They were injured swimming over waters with depths of greater than 2000 feet at night. Patients had prolonged transport times to the emergency department (ED), averaging 73 minutes, due to their injuries occurring on the open water. All were hemodynamically stable upon ED arrival and did not require blood products. Tetanus toxoid was updated, and prophylactic antibiotic coverage, including doxycycline for Vibrio spp., was administered. Two of 3 patients were treated with operative management. Open water swimmers crossing the deep waters between the Hawaiian Islands at night are most at risk for cookiecutter shark bites. Wounds may penetrate down to and through the fascial level. Immediate life-saving hemorrhage control administered by personnel accompanying the swimmers on the open water is important for preventing morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic prophylaxis for marine bacteria is recommended.
350	34818404	INVESTIGATING ASSOCIATIONS AMONG RELATEDNESS, GENETIC DIVERSITY, AND CAUSES OF MORTALITY IN SOUTHERN SEA OTTERS (ENHYDRA LUTRIS NEREIS).	Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) population recovery is influenced by a variety of factors, including predation, biotoxin exposure, infectious disease, oil spills, habitat degradation, and resource limitation. This population has also experienced a significant genetic bottleneck, resulting in low genetic diversity. We investigated how two metrics, familial relatedness and genetic diversity, are correlated with common causes of mortality in southern sea otters, including cardiomyopathy, acanthocephalan (Profilicollis spp.) peritonitis, systemic protozoal infection (Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis neurona), domoic acid intoxication, end-lactation syndrome, and shark bite. Microsatellite genetic markers were used to examine this association in 356 southern sea otters necropsied from 1998 to 2012. Significant associations with genetic diversity or familial relatedness (P<0.05) were observed for cardiomyopathy, acanthocephalan peritonitis, and sarcocystosis, and these associations varied by sex. Adult male cardiomyopathy cases (n=86) were more related than the null expectation (P<0.049). Conversely, female acanthocephalan peritonitis controls (n=110) were more related than the null expectation (P<0.004). Including genetic diversity as a predictor for fatal acanthocephalan peritonitis in the multivariate logistic model significantly improved model fit; lower genetic diversity was associated with reduced odds of sea otter death due to acanthocephalan peritonitis. Finally, male sarcocystosis controls (n=158) were more related than the null expectation (P<0.011). Including genetic diversity in the multivariate logistic model for fatal S. neurona infection improved model fit; lower genetic diversity was associated with increased odds of sea otter death due to S. neurona. Our study suggests that genetic diversity and familial relatedness, in conjunction with other factors such as age and sex, may influence outcome (survival or death) in relation to several common southern sea otter diseases. Our findings can inform policy for conservation management, such as potential reintroduction efforts, as part of species recovery.
351	34818043	Soft artificial electroreceptors for noncontact spatial perception.	Elasmobranch fishes, such as sharks, skates, and rays, use a network of electroreceptors distributed on their skin to locate adjacent prey. The receptors can detect the electric field generated by the biomechanical activity of the prey. By comparing the intensity of the electric fields sensed by each receptor in the network, the animals can perceive the relative positions of the prey without making physical contact. Inspired by this capacity for prey localization, we developed a soft artificial electroreceptor that can detect the relative positions of nearby objects in a noncontact manner by sensing the electric fields that originate from the objects. By wearing the artificial receptor, one can immediately receive spatial information of a nearby object via auditory signals. The soft artificial electroreceptor is expected to expand the ways we can perceive space by providing a sensory modality that did not evolve naturally in human beings.
352	34817876	Eye healing in a free-ranging whitespotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) following shark-inflicted bite injuries.	Here we provide the first photographic records of the eye healing of a free-ranging whitespotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari) following shark-inflicted bite injuries on the cephalic region. The whitespotted eagle ray with fresh wounds on the cephalic region close to its right orbit, upper jaw and the anterior margin of its right pectoral fin was photographed on 19 July 2017 at the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago. Two subsequent photographs of the whitespotted eagle ray with a blind right eye were taken on 29 March 2018 and 18 April 2018. These records show the whitespotted eagle ray had the capacity to recover from the wounds, although they have led to the blindness of the eye. These findings also demonstrate this individual was able to survive for at least 9 months with a nonfunctional eye.

"PURPOSE: An extensive literature has postulated multiple etiologies for aqueductal stenosis. No publications were found, discussing that evolutionary modifications might explain aqueductal anomalies. This study's objectives were to review the evolutionary modifications of vertebrates' tectum structures that might explain human aqueduct anomalies. Undertaking vertebrate comparative study is currently not feasible in view of limitations in obtaining vertebrate material. Thus, vertebrate material collected, injected, dissected, and radiographed in the early 1970s was analyzed, focusing on the aqueduct and components of the midbrain tectum.
METHODS: Photographs of brain dissections and radiographs of the cerebral ventricles and arteries of adult shark, frog, iguana, rabbit, cat, dog, and primate specimens, containing a barium-gelatin radiopaque compound, were analyzed focusing on the aqueduct, the optic ventricles, the quadrigeminal plate, and collicular ventricles. The anatomic information provided by the dissections and radiographs is not reproducible by any other radiopaque contrast currently available.
RESULTS: Dissected and radiographed cerebral ventricular and arterial systems of the vertebrates demonstrated midbrain tectum changes, including relative size modifications of the mammalian components of the tectum, simultaneously with the enlargement of the occipital lobe. There is a transformation of pre-mammalian optic ventricles to what appear to be collicular ventricles in mammals, as the aqueduct and collicular ventricle form a continuous cavity.
CONCLUSIONS: The mammalian tectum undergoes an evolutionary cephalization process consisting of relative size changes of the midbrain tectum structures. This is associated with enlargement of the occipital lobe, as part of overall neocortical expansion. Potentially, aqueductal anomalies could be explained by evolutionary modifications."
355	34807932	Emergence potential of mosquito-borne arboviruses from the Florida Everglades.	The Greater Everglades Region of South Florida is one of the largest natural wetlands and the only subtropical ecosystem found in the continental United States. Mosquitoes are seasonally abundant in the Everglades where several potentially pathogenic mosquito-borne arboviruses are maintained in natural transmission cycles involving vector-competent mosquitoes and reservoir-competent vertebrate hosts. The fragile nature of this ecosystem is vulnerable to many sources of environmental change, including a wetlands restoration project, climate change, invasive species and residential development. In this study, we obtained baseline data on the distribution and abundance of both mosquitos and arboviruses occurring in the southern Everglades region during the summer months of 2013, when water levels were high, and in 2014, when water levels were low. A total of 367,060 mosquitoes were collected with CO2-baited CDC light traps at 105 collection sites stratified among the major landscape features found in Everglades National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, Fakahatchee State Park Preserve and Picayune State Forest, an area already undergoing restoration. A total of 2,010 pools of taxonomically identified mosquitoes were cultured for arbovirus isolation and identification. Seven vertebrate arboviruses were isolated: Everglades virus, Tensaw virus, Shark River virus, Gumbo Limbo virus, Mahogany Hammock virus, Keystone virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Except for Tensaw virus, which was absent in 2013, the remaining viruses were found to be most prevalent in hardwood hammocks and in Fakahatchee, less prevalent in mangroves and pinelands, and absent in cypress and sawgrass. In contrast, in the summer of 2014 when water levels were lower, these arboviruses were far less prevalent and only found in hardwood hammocks, but Tensaw virus was present in cypress, sawgrass, pinelands, and a recently burned site. Major environmental changes are anticipated in the Everglades, many of which will result in increased water levels. How these might lead to the emergence of arboviruses potentially pathogenic to both humans and wildlife is discussed.
356	34804566	Diverse stem-chondrichthyan oral structures and evidence for an independently acquired acanthodid dentition.	The teeth of sharks famously form a series of transversely organized files with a conveyor-belt replacement that are borne directly on the jaw cartilages, in contrast to the dermal plate-borne dentition of bony fishes that undergoes site-specific replacement. A major obstacle in understanding how this system evolved is the poorly understood relationships of the earliest chondrichthyans and the profusion of morphologically and terminologically diverse bones, cartilages, splints and whorls that they possess. Here, we use tomographic methods to investigate mandibular structures in several early branching 'acanthodian'-grade stem-chondrichthyans. We show that the dentigerous jaw bones of disparate genera of ischnacanthids are united by a common construction, being growing bones with non-shedding dentition. Mandibular splints, which support the ventro-lateral edge of the Meckel's cartilage in some taxa, are formed from dermal bone and may be an acanthodid synapomorphy. We demonstrate that the teeth of

The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of fish collagen peptides (FCP) from the skin of great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran) to avert the occurrence of gastric ulcer in experimental rats. FCP treatment prevented the formation of ulcerative lesions on gastric tissues with 86% of inhibition. The histopathology analysis of gastric tissue revealed that the FCP intake prevented the occurrence of hemorrhage and erosion in gastric tissue with formation of mild edema and necrosis, as well as normalized the pH and volume of gastric juice. It also downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory marker interferon-ɤ (IFN-ɤ) and upregulated the anti-inflammatory marker interleukin-4 (IL-4) in gastric tissue. FCP is capable to modulate the oxidative stress by enhancing the activity of antioxidant defense enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase and by lowering the levels of membrane lipid peroxidation.
359	34787703	Forecasting intraspecific changes in distribution of a wide-ranging marine predator under climate change.	Globally, marine animal distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate. These shifts are usually considered at the species level, but individuals are likely to differ in how they respond to the changing conditions. Here, we investigate how movement behaviour and, therefore, redistribution, would differ by sex and maturation class in a wide-ranging marine predator. We tracked 115 tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) from 2002 to 2020 and forecast class-specific distributions through to 2030, including environmental factors and predicted occurrence of potential prey. Generalised Linear and Additive Models revealed that water temperature change, particularly at higher latitudes, was the factor most associated with shark movements. Females dispersed southwards during periods of warming temperatures, and while juvenile females preferred a narrow thermal range between 22 and 23 °C, adult female and juvenile male presence was correlated with either lower (< 22 °C) or higher (> 23 °C) temperatures. During La Niña, sharks moved towards higher latitudes and used shallower isobaths. Inclusion of predicted distribution of their putative prey significantly improved projections of suitable habitats for all shark classes, compared to simpler models using temperature alone. Tiger shark range off the east coast of Australia is predicted to extend ~ 3.5° south towards the east coast of Tasmania, particularly for juvenile males. Our framework highlights the importance of combining long-term movement data with multi-factor habitat projections to identify heterogeneity within species when predicting consequences of climate change. Recognising intraspecific variability will improve conservation and management strategies and help anticipate broader ecosystem consequences of species redistribution due to ocean warming.
360	34785864	Keeping abreast of shark bite reconstruction: a case report and brief literature review.	Shark attack-related injuries (SARIs) are rare but may result in highly complex wounds requiring reconstruction by plastic surgeons. Here, we present an unusual case of SARI of the breast and briefly review literature on reconstructive management of (1) breast injuries from other large animals and (2) SARIs to other parts of the body. Our patient was a 39-year-old woman who experienced massive bilateral breast tissue loss from a shark attack. After primary surgical wound management, including debridement and washout, the patient underwent completion mastectomy with bilateral deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction. Literature review revealed that reports of animal-related injuries to the breast are rare, with ours being the first on SARI to the breast and the only describing major reconstruction of animal-related breast injury. Literature on reconstruction of non-breast SARI wounds is limited to two case reports describing severe tissue damage akin to that seen in our patient, both necessitating extensive debridement followed by reconstruction. Overall, our findings demonstrate the uniquely devastating damage resulting from SARIs and the value of primary wound management and abdominally based free flaps in successfully reconstructing these wounds. Level of evidence: Level V, therapeutic study.
361	34781011	Morphological and molecular characterization of Paraleptus chiloscyllii Yin & Zhang, 1983 (Nematoda: Physalopteridae) from the brownbanded bambooshark Chiloscyllium punctatum Müller & Henle (Elasmobranchii: Orectolobiformes).	Paraleptus (Spirurida: Physalopteridae) is a small genus of nematodes, parasitic in fishes, most species of which are inadequately described. Genetic data for these congeners have not been reported. The detailed morphology of P. chiloscyllii was studied using light and scanning electron microscopy, based on newly collected specimens from the brownbanded bambooshark C. punctatum Müller & Henle (Elasmobranchii: Orectolobiformes) in the Taiwan Strait. Some previously unreported morphological features of taxonomic significance were observed, i.e., pseudolabium with two sublateral rows of 6-7 small spines, 7-8 small spines on each lower rim between pseudolabia, deirids not distally bifurcated, vulva with remarkable protruding lip, presence of 1 pair medio-ventral precloacal papillae and 1 pair of discoid protrusions of postcloacal lip in male. The specimens described by González-Solís & Ali's (2015) as P. chiloscyllii from the Arabian carpetshark C. arabicum off Iraq are considered a new species, for which the name P. moraveci n. sp. is proposed. The genetic characterization of the partial small (18S) and large (28S) ribosomal DNA, and the partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) of P. chiloscyllii are provided for the first time. There was no intraspecific nucleotide divergence detected in the 18S and 28S regions among different individuals of P. chiloscyllii, but a low level of intraspecific genetic variation was found in the cox1 (0.62-0.92%). The present genetic data is very important for molecular identification, and will be valuable for further invertigantions on the population genetics and phylogeny of this group.
362	34780656	Evaluation of a Quality Improvement Experience for Family Medicine Clerkship Students.	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is emphasis on systems-based practice competencies and quality improvement (QI) training in postgraduate medical education. However, we lack effective approaches to provide experiences in these areas during undergraduate medical education. To address this, we developed a novel approach to providing didactic and experiential learning experiences in QI during a third-year family medicine clerkship.
METHODS: We implemented and evaluated a QI curriculum combining self-directed learning with real-world experience to increase knowledge and confidence in the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) process for family medicine clerkship students. Students collaborated and presented their change ideas in a ""Shark Tank"" format for practice leaders at the end of their rotation. We used pre- and postcurriculum surveys to assess knowledge of and comfort with completing QI projects.
RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-nine students completed precurriculum surveys and 242 completed postcurriculum surveys. Pre- and postlearning evaluations revealed an increase in agreement or strong agreement with self-reported understanding of specific QI topic areas of 50%. Almost all (91.3%) reported feeling confident or reasonably confident in their ability to create change in health care after exposure to the curriculum, compared with 66.3% in the precurriculum survey. One-third of students (34%) reported intent to complete the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Open School curriculum in QI.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-directed learning about QI, combined with practice observation, small-group discussion and presentation in a Shark Tank format was effective and engaging for learners. Students had limited preexisting knowledge of QI principles, suggesting a need for preclinical exposure to this topic. The family medicine clerkship provides an ideal environment for teaching QI."
363	34765151	Diving deeper into the underlying white shark behaviors at Guadalupe Island, Mexico.	Fine-scale movement patterns are driven by both biotic (hunting, physiological needs) and abiotic (environmental conditions) factors. The energy balance governs all movement-related strategic decisions.Marine environments can be better understood by considering the vertical component. From 24 acoustic trackings of 10 white sharks in Guadalupe Island, this study linked, for the first time, horizontal and vertical movement data and inferred six different behavioral states along with movement states, through the use of hidden Markov models, which allowed to draw a comprehensive picture of white shark behavior.Traveling was the most frequent state of behavior for white sharks, carried out mainly at night and twilight. In contrast, area-restricted searching was the least used, occurring primarily in daylight hours.Time of day, distance to shore, total shark length, and, to a lesser extent, tide phase affected behavioral states. Chumming activity reversed, in the short term and in a nonpermanent way, the behavioral pattern to a general diel vertical pattern.
364	34749115	Mercury concentrations and trophic relations in sharks of the Pacific Ocean of Colombia.	Sharks are fished for human consumption in Colombia, and fins are exported illegally to international markets. The goal was to identify differences in total mercury (THg) concentrations in fins and muscles of shark species seized in the Buenaventura port (Colombian Pacific), and to assess potential human health risks related to shark consumption. Seven species were considered in this study: Pelagic Thresher (Alopias pelagicus), Pacific Smalltail Shark (Carcharhinus cerdale), Brown Smoothhound (Mustelus henlei), Sicklefin Smoothhound (Mustelus lunulatus), Scalloped Bonnethead (Sphyrna corona), Scalloped Hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo), and THg was analyzed in shark tissues. 24% muscle samples concentrations were above international recommended limits for human consumption, especially for A. pelagicus and S. lewini.

366	34728053	Current and future considerations for shark conservation in the Northeast and Eastern Central Pacific Ocean.	Sharks are iconic and ecologically important predators found in every ocean. Because of their ecological role as predators, some considered apex predators, and concern over the stability of their populations due to direct and indirect overfishing, there has been an increasing amount of work focussed on shark conservation, and other elasmobranchs such as skates and rays, around the world. Here we discuss many aspects of current shark science and conservation and the path to the future of shark conservation in the Northeastern and Eastern Central Pacific. We explore their roles in ecosystems as keystone species; the conservation measures and laws in place at the international, national, regional and local level; the conservation status of sharks and rays in the region, fisheries for sharks in the Northcentral Pacific specifically those that target juveniles and the implications to shark conservation; a conservation success story: the recovery of Great White Sharks in the Northeast Pacific; public perceptions of sharks and the roles zoos and aquariums play in shark conservation; and the path to the future of shark conservation that requires bold partnerships, local stakeholders and innovative measures.
367	34721282	Fossilized leftover falls as sources of palaeoecological data: a 'pabulite' comprising a crustacean, a belemnite and a vertebrate from the Early Jurassic Posidonia Shale.	Especially in Lagerstätten with exceptionally preserved fossils, we can sometimes recognize fossilized remains of meals of animals. We suggest the term leftover fall for the event and the term pabulite for the fossilized meal when it never entered the digestive tract (difference to regurgitalites). Usually, pabulites are incomplete organismal remains and show traces of the predation. Pabulites have a great potential to inform about predation as well as anatomical detail, which is invisible otherwise. Here, we document a pabulite comprising the belemnite

METHODS: Retrospective study of patients scheduled for DMEK due to Fuchs endothelial dystrophy and divided into 2 study groups: Group -M (n = 184) had no mark of the EDM (Endothelial Descemet membrane) and group + M (n = 193) had a triangular peripheral mark. Follow-up time was 1 year after surgery.
RESULTS: The postoperative graft turning and Re-DMEK rate could be significantly reduced by the use of a peripheral mark (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, respectively). Re-DMEK due to primary graft failure was significantly associated with prior graft turning (p < 0.001). Both groups showed comparable values for visual acuity, central corneal thickness and endothelial cell count after a follow-up of 1 year.
CONCLUSION: Single peripheral triangular marking is a simple and cost-saving addition to EDM preparation to ensure the correct orientation of the graft intraoperatively and could lead to a significant reduction in graft turning and re-DMEK rate in this study."
369	34709794	Low Air Drag Surface via Multilayer Hierarchical Riblets.	Riblets inspired by shark skin exhibit a great air drag reduction potential in many industries, such as the aircraft, energy, and transportation industries. Many studies have reported that blade riblets attain the highest air drag reduction ability, with a current limit of ∼11%. Here, we propose multilayer hierarchical riblets (MLHRs) to further improve the air drag reduction ability. MLHRs were fabricated via a three-layer hybrid mask lithography method, and the air drag reduction ability was studied in a closed air channel. The experimental results indicated that the maximum air drag reduction achieved with MLHRs in the closed channel was 16.67%, which represents a 52% higher reduction than the highest previously reported. Conceptual models were proposed to explain the experiments from a microscopic perspective. MLHRs enhanced the stability of lifting and pinning vortices, while vortices gradually decelerated further, reducing the momentum exchange occurring near the wall. This verified that MLHRs overcome the current air drag reduction limit of riblets. The conceptual models lay a foundation to further improve the air drag reduction ability of riblets.

Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a genus of protists that cause life-threatening and economically important diseases of human and animal populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. T. brucei cells are covered in surface glycoproteins, some of which are used to escape the host immune system. Exo-/endocytotic trafficking of these and other molecules occurs via a single copy organelle called the flagellar pocket (FP). The FP is maintained and enclosed around the flagellum by the flagellar pocket collar (FPC). To date, the most important cytoskeletal component of the FPC is an essential calcium-binding, polymer-forming protein called 
373	34703062	Behavioural thermoregulation linked to foraging in blue sharks.	"None: Large pelagic fishes often dive and surface repeatedly as if they were airbreathers, raising a question about the functions of these movements. Some species (e.g., bigeye tuna, ocean sunfish) apparently alternate foraging in deep cold waters and rewarming in shallow warm waters. However, it is unclear how prevalent this pattern is among species. Blue sharks are the widest-ranging pelagic shark with expanded vertical niches, providing a model for studying foraging-thermoregulation associations. We used electronic tags, including video cameras, to record the diving behaviour, muscle temperature, and foraging events of two blue sharks. During repeated deep dives (max. 422 m), muscle temperature changed more slowly than ambient water temperature. Sharks shifted between descents and ascents before muscle temperature reached ambient temperature, leading to a narrower range (8 °C) of muscle temperature than ambient temperature (20 °C). 2.5-h video footage showed a shark catching a squid, during which a burst swimming event was recorded. Similar swimming events, detected from the entire tag data (20 - 22 h), occurred over a wide depth range (5 - 293 m). We conclude that, instead of alternating foraging and rewarming, blue sharks at our study site forage and thermoregulate continuously in the water column. Furthermore, our comparative analyses showed that the heat exchange rates of blue sharks during the warming and cooling process were not exceptional among fishes for their body size. Thus, behavioural thermoregulation linked to foraging, rather than enhanced abilities to control heat exchange rates, is likely key to the expanded thermal niches of this ectothermic species.

374	34699727	A shark's eye view: testing the 'mistaken identity theory' behind shark bites on humans.	Shark bites on humans are rare but are sufficiently frequent to generate substantial public concern, which typically leads to measures to reduce their frequency. Unfortunately, we understand little about why sharks bite humans. One theory for bites occurring at the surface, e.g. on surfers, is that of mistaken identity, whereby sharks mistake humans for their typical prey (pinnipeds in the case of white sharks). This study tests the mistaken identity theory by comparing video footage of pinnipeds, humans swimming and humans paddling surfboards, from the perspective of a white shark viewing these objects from below. Videos were processed to reflect how a shark's retina would detect the visual motion and shape cues. Motion cues of humans swimming, humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds swimming did not differ significantly. The shape of paddled surfboards and human swimmers was also similar to that of pinnipeds with their flippers abducted. The difference in shape between pinnipeds with abducted versus adducted flippers was bigger than between pinnipeds with flippers abducted and surfboards or human swimmers. From the perspective of a white shark, therefore, neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans, supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.
375	34697815	Contemporary records of the rare and critically endangered angular rough shark, Oxynotus centrina (Linnaeus, 1758), from the eastern Adriatic Sea.	The angular rough shark, Oxynotus centrina (Linnaeus, 1758), is a poorly known and rare bathydemersal shark inhabiting continental shelves and upper slopes with a significant lack of data and rarely published records in the Adriatic Sea in this century. In this paper, we present 20 new occurrences recorded from May 2015 to September 2021, of which 19 are in Croatian and one in Montenegrin territorial waters. Records of juveniles, subadults and adults are reported. Higher number of records off the Kornati archipelago in the central Adriatic Sea suggest that this area is of particular importance for this species. Furthermore, habitats in the Southern Adriatic might have lower density. Due to the nonsystematic research and nonprobabilistic data collection, it is difficult to establish whether the greater number of records in the continental shelf is just an ostensible phenomenon.
376	34690539	Using Citizen Science to Detect Rare and Endangered Species: New Records of the Great White Shark Carcharodon Carcharias off the Libyan Coast.	The presence of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) in the Mediterranean Sea is well documented, but encounters with this species are rare and all assumptions about its spatial and temporal distribution are heavily relying on anecdotal observations. To date, only one record off the Libyan coast has been reported, raising the question if this species is underreported in these waters or simply represents a rare occasional transient. We utilised citizen science-sourced data to document the presence of the great white shark off the Libyan coast, and found six additional records for this species from the period between 2017 and 2020. Our study points out the need for scientific monitoring of this species along the Libyan coast to facilitate the establishment of effective conservation plans to protect this critically endangered species.
377	34684329	The Impact of Short-Term Shark Liver Oil Supplementation on the Fatty Acid Composition of Erythrocyte Membranes.	Fatty acid (FA) balance is strictly related to human health. The composition of fatty acids in lipid membranes seems to be influenced by diet. Shark liver oil (SLO) supplementation has been widely used recently in the prevention and treatment of human diseases. We analyzed the impact of short-term SLO supplementation on certain biochemical parameters and erythrocyte FA composition in a group of young healthy women. Our results showed that 6 weeks of SLO supplementation led to a significant decrease in C-reactive protein levels in sera and intracellular cholesterol levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SLO supplementation caused a significant increase in the content of the polyunsaturated omega-3 FAs: docosahexaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and α-linolenic acid. In the group of omega-6 FAs, we observed a significant elevation of arachidonic and dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid content. Due to these alterations, the omega-3 index increased significantly from 3.6% (before) to 4.2% (after supplementation). We also observed the impact of SLO supplementation on the membrane fluidity index. The ratio between saturated and unsaturated FAs decreased significantly from 13.1 to 9.9. In conclusion, our results show that even short-term SLO supplementation can improve human erythrocyte fatty acid composition and other parameters that may have health-promoting consequences.

381	34674635	Global shifts in species richness have shaped carpet shark evolution.	"BACKGROUND: The evolutionary processes that shape patterns of species richness in marine ecosystems are complex and may differ between organismal groups. There has been considerable interest in understanding the evolutionary processes that led to marine species richness being concentrated in specific geographical locations. In this study we focus on the evolutionary history of a group of small-to-medium sized sharks known as carpet sharks. While a few carpet shark species are widespread, the majority of carpet shark species richness is contained within a biodiversity hotspot at the boundary of the Indian and Pacific oceans. We address the significance of this biodiversity hotspot in carpet shark evolution and speciation by leveraging a rich fossil record and molecular phylogenetics to examine the prehistoric distribution of carpet sharks.
RESULTS: We find that carpet sharks species richness was greatest in shallow seas connected to the Atlantic Ocean during the Late Cretaceous, but that there was a subsequent loss of biodiversity in Atlantic waters. Fossil evidence from sites in close geographic proximity to the current center of carpet shark diversity are generally restricted to younger geologic strata.
CONCLUSIONS: From this data we conclude that (1) center of carpet shark biodiversity has shifted during the last 100 million years, (2) carpet sharks have repeatedly dispersed to nascent habitat (including to their current center of diversity), and (3) the current center of carpet shark biodiversity conserves lineages that have been extirpated from this prehistoric range and is a source of new carpet shark species. Our findings provide insights into the roles of marine biodiversity hotspots for higher-tropic level predators and the methods applied here can be used for additional studies of shark evolution."
382	34662880	Identifying Amygdala-Like Territories in Scyliorhinus canicula (Chondrichthyan): Evidence for a Pallial Amygdala.	To identify the putative amygdalar complex in cartilaginous fishes, our first step was to obtain evidence that supports the existence of a pallial amygdala in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula, at present the prevailing chondrichthyan model in comparative neurobiology and developmental biology. To this end, we analyzed the organization of the lateral walls of the telencephalic hemispheres of adults, juveniles, and early prehatching embryos by immunohistochemistry against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), somatostatin (SOM), Pax6, serotonin (5HT), substance P (SP), and Met-enkephalin (MetEnk), calbindin-28k (CB), and calretinin (CR), and by in situ hybridization against regulatory genes such as Tbr1, Lhx9, Emx1, and Dlx2. Our data were integrated with those available from the literature related to the secondary olfactory projections in this shark species. We have characterized two possible amygdalar territories. One, which may represent a ventropallial component, was identified by its chemical signature (moderate density of Pax6-ir cells, scarce TH-ir and SOM-ir cells, and absence of CR-ir and CB-ir cells) and gene expressions (Tbr1 and Lhx9 expressions in an Emx1 negative domain, as the ventral pallium of amniotes). It is perhaps comparable to the lateral amygdala of amphibians and the pallial amygdala of teleosts. The second was a territory related to the pallial-subpallial boundary with abundant Pax6-ir and CR-ir cells, and 5HT-ir, SP-ir, and MetEnk-ir fibers capping dorsally the area superficialis basalis. This olfactory-related region at the neighborhood of the pallial-subpallial boundary may represent a subpallial amygdala subdivision that possibly contains migrated cells of ventropallial origin.
383	34659860	New Methods of Reconstruction for Old Challenges: The Use of the Integra Graft in Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections of the Male Genitalia.	In this paper, we describe two cases of Fournier's gangrene (FG) in which Integra grafting was used for reconstruction. FG is a progressive necrotizing infection occurring in the perineal region and on the external genitalia. Reconstructive options using local tissue are limited due to the destruction this infection imposes on the soft tissue. Integra graft is a bilaminate artificial dermis made of shark chondroitin 6-sulfate and bovine collagen. It is applied to the wound bed after debridement and establishment of a healthy, well-vascularized wound base. The patients in this case series had large defects which could not be closed primarily with tissue beds and would not have been appropriate for skin grafting. Therefore, an Integra graft was placed. In both patients, the wound beds were appropriate for skin grafting after three weeks. Without the Integra graft, both of our patients would have needed to wait a considerable amount of time prior to reconstruction. Our case series further illustrates and supports the use of Integra grafts in such a scenario following Fournier's gangrene which has only previously been published on three occasions, all of which demonstrated successful outcomes.
385	34658037	Site fidelity and shallow genetic structure in the common smooth-hound shark Mustelus mustelus confirmed by tag-recapture and genetic data.	The common smooth-hound shark, Mustelus mustelus, is a widely distributed demersal shark under heavy exploitation from various fisheries throughout its distribution range. To assist in the development of appropriate management strategies, the authors evaluate stock structure, site fidelity and movement patterns along the species' distribution in southern Africa based on a combination of molecular and long-term tag-recapture data. Eight species-specific microsatellite markers (N = 73) and two mitochondrial genes, nicotinamide adenine dehydrogenase subunit 4 and control region (N = 45), did not reveal any significant genetic structure among neighbouring sites. Nonetheless, tagging data demonstrate a remarkable degree of site fidelity with 76% of sharks recaptured within 50 km of the original tagging location. On a larger geographic scale, dispersal is governed by oceanographic features as demonstrated by the lack of movements across the Benguela-Agulhas transition zone separating the South-East Atlantic Ocean (SEAO) and South-West Indian Ocean (SWIO) populations. Microsatellite data supported very shallow ocean-based structure (SEAO and SWIO) and historical southward gene flow following the Agulhas Current, corroborating the influence of this dynamic oceanographic system on gene flow. Moreover, no movements between Namibia and South Africa were observed, indicating that the Lüderitz upwelling formation off the Namibian coast acts as another barrier to dispersal and gene flow. Overall, these results show that dispersal and stock structure of M. mustelus are governed by a combination of behavioural traits and oceanographic features such as steep temperature gradients, currents and upwelling systems.

Regional migration of the copper shark Carcharhinus brachyurus was recorded for the first time in the Southwest Atlantic (SWA) from Argentina (latitude: -38.1037, longitude: -57.5371) to Brazil (latitude: -20.6833, longitude: -40.2846) as a result of a citizen science tagging project. The recaptured specimen was a female (103 kg weight), with 18 developing embryos within the uterus. The total distance was at least 2566 km, and it is the longest ever recorded for the species. Furthermore, it extends its northern distribution in the SWA.
387	34655080	Nursery habitat use patterns of the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, in coastal areas of the central Mexican Pacific.	This work aimed to characterize the nursery habitat use patterns of the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini (SPL), in coastal areas of Jalisco and Colima, through the birth pattern, space-time distribution and relationship with environmental conditions. Information was combined from three sources: monitoring bycatch from the artisanal fishery, fishery-independent samplings, and acoustic tracking and monitoring. From September 2013 to May 2017, 408 juvenile SPL (41.6-100.1 cm total length) were recorded. Births occurred between May and December (rainy-warmer season), within a radius of 2 km from river mouths in Marabasco, Navidad Bay, Rebalsito-Tecuan and Cuitzmala mainly in shallow (<20 m), turbid and soft-bottom areas. Some tagged SPL moved from Marabasco and Rebalsito to Navidad Bay. The peak of catch and births occurred in June-August. Tagged SPL remained near the river mouth in Rebalsito for up to 27 days, showing a mean residency index of 0.29, a home range of 5.55 km
388	34652820	Incorporating thermodynamics in predator-prey games predicts the diel foraging patterns of poikilothermic predators.	Models of foraging behaviour typically assume that prey do not adapt to temporal variation in predation risk, such as by avoiding foraging at certain times of the day. When this behavioural plasticity is considered-such as in predator-prey games-the role of abiotic factors is usually ignored. An abiotic factor that exerts strong influence on the physiology and behaviour of many animals is ambient temperature, although it is often ignored from game models as it is implicitly assumed that both predators and prey are homothermic. However, poikilotherms' performance may be reduced in cold conditions due to reduced muscle function, limiting the prey-capture ability of predators and the predator-avoidance and foraging abilities of prey. Here, we use a game-theoretic predator-prey model in which diel temperature changes influence foraging gains and costs to predict the evolutionarily stable diel activity of predators. Our model predicts the range of patterns observed in nature, including nocturnal, diurnal, crepuscular and a previously unexplained post-sunset crepuscular pattern observed in some sharks. In general, smaller predators are predicted to be more diurnal than larger ones. The safety of prey when not foraging is critical, explaining why predators in coral reef systems (with safe refuges) may often have different foraging patterns to pelagic predators. We make a range of testable predictions that will enable the further evaluation of this theoretical framework for understanding diel foraging patterns in poikilotherms.
390	34650989	Developmental Evolution of Hypaxial Muscles: Insights From Cyclostomes and Chondrichthyans.	Jawed vertebrates possess two distinct groups of muscles in the trunk (epaxial and hypaxial muscles) primarily defined by the pattern of motor innervation from the spinal cord. Of these, the hypaxial group includes muscles with highly differentiated morphology and function, such as the muscles associated with paired limbs, shoulder girdles and tongue/infrahyoid (hypobranchial) muscles. Here we summarize the latest findings on the evolutionary mechanisms underlying the morphological variety of hypaxial musculature, with special reference to the molecular insights obtained from several living species that diverged early in vertebrate evolution. Lampreys, extant jawless vertebrates, lack many of derived traits characteristic of the gnathostomes, such as jaws, paired fins and epaxial/hypaxial distinction of the trunk skeletal musculatures. However, these animals possess the primitive form of the hypobranchial muscle. Of the gnathostomes, the elasmobranchs exhibit developmental mode of hypaxial muscles that is not identical to that of other gnathostomes in that the muscle primordia relocate as coherent cell aggregates. Comparison of expression of developmental genes, including 
391	34645878	Passive acoustic monitoring of killer whales (Orcinus orca) reveals year-round distribution and residency patterns in the Gulf of Alaska.	Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are top predators throughout the world's oceans. In the North Pacific, the species is divided into three ecotypes-resident (fish-eating), transient (mammal-eating), and offshore (largely shark-eating)-that are genetically and acoustically distinct and have unique roles in the marine ecosystem. In this study, we examined the year-round distribution of killer whales in the northern Gulf of Alaska from 2016 to 2020 using passive acoustic monitoring. We further described the daily acoustic residency patterns of three killer whale populations (southern Alaska residents, Gulf of Alaska transients, and AT1 transients) for one year of these data. Highest year-round acoustic presence occurred in Montague Strait, with strong seasonal patterns in Hinchinbrook Entrance and Resurrection Bay. Daily acoustic residency times for the southern Alaska residents paralleled seasonal distribution patterns. The majority of Gulf of Alaska transient detections occurred in Hinchinbrook Entrance in spring. The depleted AT1 transient killer whale population was most often identified in Montague Strait. Passive acoustic monitoring revealed that both resident and transient killer whales used these areas much more extensively than previously known and provided novel insights into high use locations and times for each population. These results may be driven by seasonal foraging opportunities and social factors and have management implications for this species.

394	34641390	Greener Synthesis of Pristane by Flow Dehydrative Hydrogenation of Allylic Alcohol Using a Packed-Bed Reactor Charged by Pd/C as a Single Catalyst.	Our previous work established a continuous-flow synthesis of pristane, which is a saturated branched alkane obtained from a Basking Shark. The dehydration of an allylic alcohol that is the key to a tetraene was carried out using a packed-bed reactor charged by an acid-silica catalyst (HO-SAS) and flow hydrogenation using molecular hydrogen via a Pd/C catalyst followed. The present work relies on the additional propensity of Pd/C to serve as an acid catalyst, which allows us to perform a flow synthesis of pristane from the aforementioned key allylic alcohol in the presence of molecular hydrogen using Pd/C as a single catalyst, which is applied to both dehydration and hydrogenation. The present one-column-two-reaction-flow system could eliminate the use of an acid catalyst such as HO-SAS and lead to a significant simplification of the production process.
395	34637549	Single domain shark VNAR antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.	Single domain shark variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) antibodies can offer a viable alternative to conventional Ig-based monoclonal antibodies in treating COVID-19 disease during the current pandemic. Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in vitro. In addition, three antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies, due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition, and formatting flexibility, should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.
396	34636316	Anti-Angiogenic and Cytotoxicity Effects of Selachyl Alcohol Analogues.	"BACKGROUND: The active ingredients in the shark liver oil (SLO) mixture were found to be a group of etherlinked glycerol known as alkylglycerols (AKGs). During the last century, initial clinical use of the SLO mixture was for treating leukemias and later preventing radiation sickness from cancer x-ray therapy. Selachyl alcohol is one of the most abundant AKGs in the SLO mixture and it displayed strong activity in reducing lung metastasis number on a model of grafted tumor in mice (Lewis lung carcinoma cells).
OBJECTIVES: In this study, selachyl alcohol analogue containing methoxyl (7), gem-difluorinated (8), azide (9) and hydroxyl (10) group at the 12 position in the alkyl chain were synthesized and compared regarding their cytotoxicity and anti-migratory effects on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell line.
METHODS: AKGs 7-10 were synthesized according to the literature procedure. The cytotoxicity of the studied AKGs was evaluated by the MTT test and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell line (HUVEC) was used as an in vitro model to evaluate their anti-migratory effects.
RESULTS: The four AKGs have substantially the same toxicity threshold (≥ 12 μM), whereas they have an anti-migratory activity significantly different on endothelial cells. AKGs 9 and 10 significantly reduce the chemotactic migration induced by VEGF, but analogue (10) containing the hydroxyl group at the 12 position in the alkyl chain was the most potent anti-VEGF inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: We presented here a series of four synthetic selachyl alcohol analogues, among which AKGs 9 and 10 showed the ability to inhibit endothelial cell migration. The relationship structures and anti-VEGF effects of these analogues were also evaluated and discussed. Unnatural synthesized AKGs could be explored as one new source of anticancer agents."

398	34619503	Space use patterns of sharks in relation to boat activity in an urbanized coastal waterway.	Aquatic ecosystems face numerous anthropogenic threats associated with coastal urbanization, with boat activity being among the most prevalent. The present study aimed to evaluate a potential relationship between boat activity and shark space use in Biscayne Bay, Florida (USA), a coastal waterway exposed to high levels of boating. Spatiotemporal patterns in boat density and traffic were determined from aerial surveys and underwater acoustic recorders, respectively. These data were then compared with residency patterns of bull (Carcharhinus leucas), nurse (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) sharks quantified through passive acoustic telemetry. Results were mixed, with no detectable relationship between boat density and shark residency for any of the species. Hourly presence of G. cirratum decreased with increasing boat traffic, a relationship not seen in the other two species. Explanations for these results include habituation of sharks to the high levels of chronic boat activity in the study area and interspecific differences in hearing sensitivity.

400	34614390	Feeding ecology has shaped the evolution of modern sharks.	"Sharks are iconic predators in today's oceans, yet their modern diversity has ancient origins. In particular, present hypotheses suggest that a combination of mass extinction, global climate change, and competition has regulated the community structure of dominant mackerel (Lamniformes) and ground (Carcharhiniformes) sharks over the last 66 million years. However, while these scenarios advocate an interplay of major abiotic and biotic events, the precise drivers remain obscure. Here, we focus on the role of feeding ecology using a geometric morphometric analysis of 3,837 fossil and extant shark teeth. Our results reveal that morphological segregation rather than competition has characterized lamniform and carcharhiniform evolution. Moreover, although lamniforms suffered a long-term disparity decline potentially linked to dietary ""specialization,"" their recent disparity rivals that of ""generalist"" carcharhiniforms. We further confirm that low eustatic sea levels impacted lamniform disparity across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. Adaptations to changing prey availability and the proliferation of coral reef habitats during the Paleogene also likely facilitated carcharhiniform dispersals and cladogenesis, underpinning their current taxonomic dominance. Ultimately, we posit that trophic partitioning and resource utilization shaped past shark ecology and represent critical determinants for their future species survivorship."
401	34611723	Symbiotic Siphonostomatoida (Copepoda) of the hammerhead shark species Sphyrna zygaena (Carcharhiniformes: Sphyrnidae) and stingray Dasyatis pastinaca  (Myliobatiformes: Dasyatidae) off the Canary Islands, with a re-description of  Pseudocharopinus pillaii Kabata, 1979.	The biology, including accompanying ectoparasitic fauna, remains unstudied for several elasmobranchs off the Canary Islands in spite of concerns over their conservation. Within this region, this is the first report of copepod associations with these fishes. Twenty smooth hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna zygaena, and one common stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca, were inspected for symbionts on their body surface. Symbiotic siphonostomatoids were collected from 18 S. zygaena hosts and represent two different species, i.e., Alebion crassus (Caligidae) and Pandarus cranchii (Pandaridae). A high prevalence of 90% and a mean infection of 8.3 individuals per infected host were exhibited by A. crassus, while only a single P. cranchii was collected. Both these findings represent new geographical records. Additionally, one free-ranging common stingray Dasyatis pastinaca was opportunistically inspected and 11 Pseudocharopinus pillaii (Lernaeopodidae) collected which constitutes a new host record and a new geographical record. A re-description with detail regarding the morphology of the appendages is provided for the first time. Due to the morphological similarity between P. pillaii and P. malleus, a molecular analysis of the partial mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene was done in an attempt to determine if there is molecular divergence between the two species. This provided an estimate of the phylogenetic relationships amongst four Pseudocharopinus species (P. bicaudatus, P. pteromylaei, P. malleus, and P. pillaii) with Charopinus dubius as an outgroup as an alternative hypothesis to compare with the previous morphological topology estimated for all Pseudocharopinus species.
402	34610033	Observations of sharks (Elasmobranchii) at Europa Island, a remote marine protected area important for shark conservation in the southern Mozambique Channel.	Sharks have declined worldwide and remote sanctuaries are becoming crucial for shark conservation. The southwest Indian Ocean is a hotspot of both terrestrial and marine biodiversity mostly impacted by anthropogenic damage. Sharks were observed during surveys performed from April to June 2013 in the virtually pristine coral reefs around Europa Island, a remote Marine Protected Area located in the southern Mozambique Channel. Observation events comprised 67 1-hour scientific dives between 5 - 35m depth and 7 snorkeling inspections, as well as 4 dinghy-based observations in the shallow lagoon. In a period of 24 days, 475 sharks were tallied. Carcharhinus galapagensis was most encountered and contributed 20% of the abundance during diving, followed by C. albimarginatus (10%). Both species were more abundant between 11-14h, and on the exposed sides of the island. Numbers of Sphyrna lewini were highest with 370 individuals windward and leeward, mostly schooling. S. lewini aggregations in the area are hypothesized to be attracted to the seamount archipelago offering favorable conditions for deep incursions and of which Europa Island forms part. C. amblyrhynchos, Galeocerdo cuvier and S. mokarran were uncommon, while there was an additional observation of Rhincodon typus. The lagoon of Europa was a nursery ground for C. melanopterus where it was the only species present. A total of 8 species was recorded, contributing to the shark diversity of 15 species reported from Europa since 1952 in the scientific and gray literature. Overall, with the occurrence of several species of apex predators in addition to that of R. typus, large schools of S. lewini, fair numbers of reef sharks and a nursery of C. melanopterus, Europa's sharks constitute a significant reservoir of biodiversity, which contributes to preserve the functioning of the ecosystem. Our observations highlight the relevance of Europa Island for shark conservation and the need for shark-targeted management in the EEZ of both Europa and Bassas da India.

Blue sharks (Prionace glauca) are an important resource in Ecuador's fisheries; however, biological and ecological information of this species in the area is scarce. The goal of this study was to determine Hg and Cd concentration levels in muscle tissue, as well as its relationship with size, sex, and sexual maturity stages. A total of 80 specimens (34 females and 46 males) collected from the Ecuadorian longline fishing fleet between June and December 2012 were examined. Sizes for females ranged from 97 to 280 cm total length, with values of Hg between 0.20 to 2.38 mg kg
405	34585939	Nanolatticed Architecture Mitigates Damage in Shark Egg Cases.	Structural versatility and multifunctionality of biological materials have resulted in countless bioinspired strategies seeking to emulate the properties of nature. The nanostructured egg case of swell sharks is one of the toughest permeable membranes known and, thus, presents itself as a model system for materials where the conflicting properties, strength and porosity, are desirable. The egg case possesses an intricately ordered structure that is designed to protect delicate embryos from the external environment while enabling respiratory and metabolic exchange, achieving a tactical balance between conflicting properties. Herein, structural analyses revealed an enabling nanolattice architecture that constitutes a Bouligand-like nanoribbon hierarchical assembly. Three distinct hierarchical architectural adaptations enhance egg case survival: Bouligand-like organization for in-plane isotropic reinforcement, noncylindrical nanoribbons maximizing interfacial stress distribution, and highly ordered nanolattices enabling permeability and lattice-governed toughening mechanisms. These discoveries provide fundamental insights for the improvement of multifunctional membranes, fiber-reinforced soft composites, and mechanical metamaterials.

408	34580542	The power of national acoustic tracking networks to assess the impacts of human activity on marine organisms during the COVID-19 pandemic.	COVID-19 restrictions have led to an unprecedented global hiatus in anthropogenic activities, providing a unique opportunity to assess human impact on biological systems. Here, we describe how a national network of acoustic tracking receivers can be leveraged to assess the effects of human activity on animal movement and space use during such global disruptions. We outline variation in restrictions on human activity across Australian states and describe four mechanisms affecting human interactions with the marine environment: 1) reduction in economy and trade changing shipping traffic; 2) changes in export markets affecting commercial fisheries; 3) alterations in recreational activities; and 4) decline in tourism. We develop a roadmap for the analysis of acoustic tracking data across various scales using Australia's national Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Animal Tracking Facility as a case study. We illustrate the benefit of sustained observing systems and monitoring programs by assessing how a 51-day break in white shark (
409	34573616	A Taxonomic Survey of Female Oviducal Glands in Chondrichthyes: A Comparative Overview of Microanatomy in the Two Reproductive Modes.	Oviducal glands (OGs) are distinct expanded regions of the anterior portion of the oviduct, commonly found in chondrichthyans, which play a key role in the production of the egg in-vestments and in the female sperm storage (FSS). The FSS phenomenon has implications for understanding the reproductive ecology and management of exploited populations, but little information is available on its taxonomic extent. For the first time, mature OGs from three lecithotrophic oviparous and four yolk-sac viviparous species, all considered at risk from the fishing impacts in the central western Mediterranean Sea, were examined using light microscopy. The OG microanatomy, whose morphology is generally conserved in all species, shows differences within the two reproductive modalities. Oviparous species show a more developed baffle zone in respect to viviparous ones because of the production of different egg envelopes produced. Among oviparous species,

This study is the first to investigate this ability in two elasmobranch species. All animals were trained in two-alternative forced-choice visual experiments and then examined in transfer tests, to determine if previously gained knowledge could be applied to new tasks. Results show that the grey bamboo shark (
411	34573551	Passive Prey Discrimination in Surface Predatory Behaviour of Bait-Attracted White Sharks from Gansbaai, South Africa.	Between the years 2008 and 2013, six annual research expeditions were carried out at Dyer Island (Gansbaai, South Africa) to study the surface behaviour of white sharks in the presence of two passive prey: tuna bait and a seal-shaped decoy. Sightings were performed from a commercial cage-diving boat over 247 h; 250 different white sharks, with a mean total length (TL) of 308 cm, were observed. Of these, 166 performed at least one or more interactions, for a total of 240 interactions with bait and the seal-shaped decoy. In Gansbaai, there is a population of transient white sharks consisting mainly of immature specimens throughout the year. Both mature and immature sharks preferred to prey on the seal-shaped decoy, probably due to the dietary shift that occurs in white sharks whose TL varies between 200 cm and 340 cm. As it is widely confirmed that white sharks change their diet from a predominantly piscivorous juvenile diet to a mature marine mammalian diet, it is possible that Gansbaai may be a hunting training area and that sharks show a discriminate food choice, a strategy that was adopted by the majority of specimens thanks to their ability to visualize energetically richer prey, after having been attracted by the odorous source represented by the tuna bait.
412	34548488	Spatial regulation by multiple Gremlin1 enhancers provides digit development with cis-regulatory robustness and evolutionary plasticity.	Precise cis-regulatory control of gene expression is essential for normal embryogenesis and tissue development. The BMP antagonist Gremlin1 (Grem1) is a key node in the signalling system that coordinately controls limb bud development. Here, we use mouse reverse genetics to identify the enhancers in the Grem1 genomic landscape and the underlying cis-regulatory logics that orchestrate the spatio-temporal Grem1 expression dynamics during limb bud development. We establish that transcript levels are controlled in an additive manner while spatial regulation requires synergistic interactions among multiple enhancers. Disrupting these interactions shows that altered spatial regulation rather than reduced Grem1 transcript levels prefigures digit fusions and loss. Two of the enhancers are evolutionary ancient and highly conserved from basal fishes to mammals. Analysing these enhancers from different species reveal the substantial spatial plasticity in Grem1 regulation in tetrapods and basal fishes, which provides insights into the fin-to-limb transition and evolutionary diversification of pentadactyl limbs.

415	34526519	Secondary predation constrains DNA-based diet reconstruction in two threatened shark species.	Increasing fishing effort, including bycatch and discard practices, are impacting marine biodiversity, particularly among slow-to-reproduce taxa such as elasmobranchs, and specifically sharks. While some fisheries involving sharks are sustainably managed, collateral mortalities continue, contributing towards > 35% of species being threatened with extinction. To effectively manage shark stocks, life-history information, including resource use and feeding ecologies is pivotal, especially among those species with wide-ranging distributions. Two cosmopolitan sharks bycaught off eastern Australia are the common blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus; globally classified as Near Threatened) and great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran; Critically Endangered). We opportunistically sampled the digestive tracts of these two species (and also any whole prey; termed the 'Russian-doll' approach), caught in bather-protection gillnets off northern New South Wales, to investigate the capacity for DNA metabarcoding to simultaneously determine predator and prey regional feeding ecologies. While sample sizes were small, S. mokkaran fed predominantly on stingrays and skates (Myliobatiformes and Rajiformes), but also teleosts, while C. limbatus mostly consumed teleosts. Metabarcoding assays showed extensive intermixing of taxa from the digestive tracts of predators and their whole prey, likely via the predator's stomach chyme, negating the opportunity to distinguish between primary and secondary predation. This Russian-doll effect requires further investigation in DNA metabarcoding studies focussing on dietary preferences and implies that any outcomes will need to be interpreted concomitant with traditional visual approaches.
416	34526166	Morphology and phylogeny of the parasitic nematode Mooleptus rabuka (Machida, Ogawa &amp; Okiyama, 1982) (Rhabditida, Spirurina: Mooleptinae nom. nov.), with notes on taxonomy of the family Gnathostomatidae.	The nematode Mooleptus rabuka is recorded in the digestive tract of catshark Apristurus fedorovi caught at the Imperial Ridge (Pacific Ocean). Important morphological features such as the number of cephalic and caudal papillae, the position of amphids and the shape of the gubernaculum are detailed in this parasite species. According to the phylogenetic analyses based on the 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequences, M. rabuka forms a lineage, Mooleptinae nom. nov., which is close to the gnathostomatid genus Echinocephalus (maximum likelihood analysis), or else forms a polytomy with this genus and the lineages of Anguillicola + Spiroxys and Tanqua + 'Linstowinema' sp. (Bayesian inference analysis). Overall, our findings do not support the monophyly of the Gnathostomatidae. We elevate spiroxyines to the family status, Spiroxyidae stat. nov., and temporarily consider the Gnathostomatidae to include the following subfamilies: Ancyracanthinae Yorke & Maplestone, 1926, Gnathostomatinae Railliet, 1895 sensu lato and Mooleptinae nom. nov. The name Mooleptinae nom. nov. is suggested instead of the Metaleptinae Moravec & Nagasawa, 2000, which is based on a preoccupied generic name Metaleptus Machida, Ogawa & Okiyama, 1982.
417	34526135	Elasmobranch microbiomes: emerging patterns and implications for host health and ecology.	Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) are of broad ecological, economic, and societal value. These globally important fishes are experiencing sharp population declines as a result of human activity in the oceans. Research to understand elasmobranch ecology and conservation is critical and has now begun to explore the role of body-associated microbiomes in shaping elasmobranch health. Here, we review the burgeoning efforts to understand elasmobranch microbiomes, highlighting microbiome variation among gastrointestinal, oral, skin, and blood-associated niches. We identify major bacterial lineages in the microbiome, challenges to the field, key unanswered questions, and avenues for future work. We argue for prioritizing research to determine how microbiomes interact mechanistically with the unique physiology of elasmobranchs, potentially identifying roles in host immunity, disease, nutrition, and waste processing. Understanding elasmobranch-microbiome interactions is critical for predicting how sharks and rays respond to a changing ocean and for managing healthy populations in managed care.
418	34525094	Connecting post-release mortality to the physiological stress response of large coastal sharks in a commercial longline fishery.	Bycatch mortality is a major factor contributing to shark population declines. Post-release mortality (PRM) is particularly difficult to quantify, limiting the accuracy of stock assessments. We paired blood-stress physiology with animal-borne accelerometers to quantify PRM rates of sharks caught in a commercial bottom longline fishery. Blood was sampled from the same individuals that were tagged, providing direct correlation between stress physiology and animal fate for sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus, N = 130), blacktip (C. limbatus, N = 105), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier, N = 52), spinner (C. brevipinna, N = 14), and bull sharks (C. leucas, N = 14). PRM rates ranged from 2% and 3% PRM in tiger and sandbar sharks to 42% and 71% PRM in blacktip and spinner sharks, respectively. Decision trees based on blood values predicted mortality with >67% accuracy in blacktip and spinner sharks, and >99% accuracy in sandbar sharks. Ninety percent of PRM occurred within 5 h after release and 59% within 2 h. Blood physiology indicated that PRM was primarily associated with acidosis and increases in plasma potassium levels. Total fishing mortality reached 62% for blacktip and 89% for spinner sharks, which may be under-estimates given that some soak times were shortened to focus on PRM. Our findings suggest that no-take regulations may be beneficial for sandbar, tiger, and bull sharks, but less effective for more susceptible species such as blacktip and spinner sharks.

We investigated the extent to which coral richness predicts intra-family fish richness, while simultaneously integrating a striking aspect of reef ecosystems-coral hue. To do so, we quantified the coral richness, coral hue diversity, and species richness within 25 fish families in 74 global ecoregions. We then expanded this to an analysis of all reef fishes (4465 species). Considering coral bleaching as a natural experiment, we subsequently examined hue's contribution to fish communities. Coral species and hue diversity significantly predict each family's fish richness, with the highest correlations (> 80%) occurring in damselfish, butterflyfish, emperors and rabbitfish, lower (60-80%) in substrate-bound and mid-water taxa such as blennies, seahorses, and parrotfish, and lowest (40-60%) in sharks, morays, grunts and triggerfish. The observed trends persisted globally. Coral bleaching's homogenization of reef colouration revealed hue's contribution to maintaining fish richness, abundance, and recruit survivorship. We propose that each additional coral species and associated hue provide added ecological opportunities (e.g. camouflage, background contrast for intraspecific display), facilitating the evolution and co-existence of diverse fish assemblages.
423	34518065	Patient survival and limb salvage after shark attack with major vascular injury: A case report.	Shark attacks are rare unique pathological processes. Some of them represent devastating injuries with a high morbidity and significant mortality. Related published articles are limited. The increased human interaction within the environment of sharks is the cause of rising incidence of such attacks. This study reported a case of level 4 shark injuries (shark-induced trauma scale) in a 33-year-old male patient, who presented with an extensive injury of the right lower limb with the characteristic features of shark bite. At admission the patient was in a state of shock with profuse bleeding that was controlled by tourniquet. The patient was resuscitated according to the advanced trauma life support. Clinical examination showed hard signs of vascular injury with absent pedal pulse, associated neurological deficits and severance at the knee joint. Prompt vascular intervention after resuscitation was performed to manage the major vascular injuries, together with proper washout and debridement of all the necrotic tissues under strong antibiotic coverage to prevent infection. After that, the patient underwent sequenced plastic, orthopedic, and neurological interventions. Strict follow-up was conducted, which showed that the patient was saved and achieved a functioning limb. This study aims to highlight the management of level 4 shark injuries, which are considered serious and challenging with a high fatality rate and a great risk of amputation due to the associated major vascular injuries. Immediate well organized management plan is crucial. Prompt resuscitation and surgical intervention by a highly-skilled medical team are required to improve the chance of patient survival and limb salvage.
424	34517211	Etmopterus lantern sharks use coelenterazine as the substrate for their luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence system.	The lantern shark genus Etmopterus contains approximately 40 species of deep-sea bioluminescent cartilaginous fishes. They emit blue light mainly from the ventral body surface. The biological functions of this bioluminescence have been discussed based on the luminescence patterns, but the bioluminescence mechanism remains uncertain. In this study, we detected both coelenterazine and coelenterazine-dependent luciferase activity in the ventral photophore tissue of Etmopterus molleri. The results suggested that bioluminescence in lantern sharks is produced using coelenterazine as the substrate for the luciferin-luciferase reaction, as some luminous bony fishes.

Although propofol infusion syndrome-electrocardiographic abnormalities are usually described as Brugada-pattern, in unique cases nearly ubiquitous and extensive J-point and ST-segment elevation may be observed. These patients should undergo an ajmaline test following recovery. (
426	34499686	Evaluating artisanal fishing of globally threatened sharks and rays in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh.	Sharks and rays are at risk of extinction globally. This reflects low resilience to increasing fishing pressure, exacerbated by habitat loss, climate change, increasing value in a trade and inadequate information leading to limited conservation actions. Artisanal fisheries in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh contribute to the high levels of global fishing pressure on elasmobranchs. However, it is one of the most data-poor regions of the world, and the diversity, occurrence and conservation needs of elasmobranchs in this region have not been adequately assessed. This study evaluated elasmobranch diversity, species composition, catch and trade within the artisanal fisheries to address this critical knowledge gap. Findings show that elasmobranch diversity in Bangladesh has previously been underestimated. In this study, over 160000 individual elasmobranchs were recorded through landing site monitoring, comprising 88 species (30 sharks and 58 rays) within 20 families and 35 genera. Of these, 54 are globally threatened according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with ten species listed as Critically Endangered and 22 species listed as Endangered. Almost 98% juvenile catch (69-99% for different species) for large species sand a decline in numbers of large individuals were documented, indicating unsustainable fisheries. Several previously common species were rarely landed, indicating potential population declines. The catch pattern showed seasonality and, in some cases, gear specificity. Overall, Bangladesh was found to be a significant contributor to shark and ray catches and trade in the Bay of Bengal region. Effective monitoring was not observed at the landing sites or processing centres, despite 29 species of elasmobranchs being protected by law, many of which were frequently landed. On this basis, a series of recommendations were provided for improving the conservation status of the elasmobranchs in this region. These include the need for improved taxonomic research, enhanced monitoring of elasmobranch stocks, and the highest protection level for threatened taxa. Alongside political will, enhancing national capacity to manage and rebuild elasmobranch stocks, coordinated regional management measures are essential.

During a behavioural survey of a tagged whale shark (Rhincodon typus) conducted in 2019 in the waters off Kagoshima, Japan, a typhoon passed close to the area under surveillance. As the typhoon approached, monitoring of the shark's movements indicated that it dived to depths of up to 90 m, and during this period, the authors recorded the effects of the typhoon-induced waves. They also detected changes in the vertical thermal structure of the waters, possibly due to the disturbance caused by the typhoon.
428	34492229	Overfishing drives over one-third of all sharks and rays toward a global extinction crisis.	The scale and drivers of marine biodiversity loss are being revealed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessment process. We present the first global reassessment of 1,199 species in Class Chondrichthyes-sharks, rays, and chimeras. The first global assessment (in 2014) concluded that one-quarter (24%) of species were threatened. Now, 391 (32.6%) species are threatened with extinction. When this percentage of threat is applied to Data Deficient species, more than one-third (37.5%) of chondrichthyans are estimated to be threatened, with much of this change resulting from new information. Three species are Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), representing possibly the first global marine fish extinctions due to overfishing. Consequently, the chondrichthyan extinction rate is potentially 25 extinctions per million species years, comparable to that of terrestrial vertebrates. Overfishing is the universal threat affecting all 391 threatened species and is the sole threat for 67.3% of species and interacts with three other threats for the remaining third: loss and degradation of habitat (31.2% of threatened species), climate change (10.2%), and pollution (6.9%). Species are disproportionately threatened in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Science-based limits on fishing, effective marine protected areas, and approaches that reduce or eliminate fishing mortality are urgently needed to minimize mortality of threatened species and ensure sustainable catch and trade of others. Immediate action is essential to prevent further extinctions and protect the potential for food security and ecosystem functions provided by this iconic lineage of predators.
429	34488638	Seeing through sedimented waters: environmental DNA reduces the phantom diversity of sharks and rays in turbid marine habitats.	"BACKGROUND: Sharks and rays are some of the most threatened marine taxa due to the high levels of bycatch and significant demand for meat and fin-related products in many Asian communities. At least 25% of shark and ray species are considered to be threatened with extinction. In particular, the density of reef sharks in the Pacific has declined to 3-10% of pre-human levels. Elasmobranchs are thought to be sparse in highly urbanised and turbid environments. Low visibility coupled with the highly elusive behaviour of sharks and rays pose a challenge to diversity estimation and biomonitoring efforts as sightings are limited to chance encounters or from carcasses ensnared in nets. Here we utilised an eDNA metabarcoding approach to enhance the precision of elasmobranch diversity estimates in urbanised marine environments.
RESULTS: We applied eDNA metabarcoding on seawater samples to detect elasmobranch species in the hyper-urbanised waters off Singapore. Two genes-vertebrate 12S and elasmobranch COI-were targeted and amplicons subjected to Illumina high-throughput sequencing. With a total of 84 water samples collected from nine localities, we found 47 shark and ray molecular operational taxonomic units, of which 16 had species-level identities. When data were compared against historical collections and contemporary sightings, eDNA detected 14 locally known species as well as two potential new records.
CONCLUSIONS: Local elasmobranch richness uncovered by eDNA is greater than the seven species sighted over the last two decades, thereby reducing phantom diversity. Our findings demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding is effective in detecting shark and ray species despite the challenges posed by the physical environment, granting a more consistent approach to monitor these highly elusive and threatened species."
431	34476811	Phylogeography and population genetics of the cryptic bonnethead shark Sphyrna aff. tiburo in Brazil and the Caribbean inferred from mtDNA markers.	Resolving the identity, phylogeny and distribution of cryptic species within species complexes is an essential precursor to management. The bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, is a small coastal shark distributed in the Western Atlantic from North Carolina (U.S.A.) to southern Brazil. Genetic analyses based on mitochondrial markers revealed that bonnethead sharks comprise a species complex with at least two lineages in the Northwestern Atlantic and the Caribbean (S. tiburo and Sphyrna aff. tiburo, respectively). The phylogeographic and phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial markers [control region (mtCR) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI)] showed that bonnethead sharks from southeastern Brazil correspond to S. aff. tiburo, extending the distribution of this cryptic species >5000 km. Bonnethead shark populations are only managed in the U.S.A. and in the 2000s were considered to be regionally extinct or collapsed in southeast Brazil. The results indicate that there is significant genetic differentiation between S. aff. tiburo from Brazil and other populations from the Caribbean (Φ
432	34476804	Preliminary observations on the movement ecology of a crested horn shark (Heterodontus galeatus).	The residency and movements of a single acoustically tagged female crested horn shark (Heterodontus galeatus) were monitored in Jervis Bay, Australia. The individual was intermittently detected by receivers throughout the 8-year study period and showed preference for particular rocky reefs in terms of its residency indices and duration of residency events. This individual exhibited lower residency and dissimilar movement patterns to that of the well-studied and sympatric Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), highlighting the need for research into the basic life history and movement ecology of H. galeatus.
433	34470974	Clistobothrium sp. (Cestoda: Tetraphyllidea) in oarfish (Regalecus russelii) stranded on the coast of Akita Prefecture, Japan.	Oarfish (Regalecus russelii Cuvier) are mesopelagic fish with little known about their life history. Oarfish live in deep water, making it difficult for researchers to collect specimens; thus, records of their parasitic helminths are limited. Two plerocercoids were found for the first time in an oarfish stranded on the coast of Akita Prefecture, Japan. These plerocercoids were identified as Clistobothrium sp. RR-1 using morphological and molecular analyses. It was revealed that oarfish represent one of the intermediate hosts of the genus Clistobothrium, and large sharks are the definitive hosts for these parasites.
434	34457309	Simulated heatwave and fishing stressors alter corticosteroid and energy balance in neonate blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus.	The increasing frequency and duration of marine heatwaves attributed to climate change threatens coastal elasmobranchs and may exacerbate existing anthropogenic stressors. While the elasmobranch stress response has been well studied, the role of the unique corticosteroid-1α-hydroxycorticosterone (1α-OHB)-in energy balance is not understood. Therefore, 1α-OHB's utility as a stress biomarker in elasmobranch conservation physiology is equivocal. Here, we analyse the roles of corticosteroids, 1α-OHB and corticosterone, and metabolites, glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), in response to stress in a protected tropical shark species, the blacktip reef shark (
435	34451718	Green Microalgae Strain Improvement for the Production of Sterols and Squalene.	Sterols and squalene are essential biomolecules required for the homeostasis of eukaryotic membrane permeability and fluidity. Both compounds have beneficial effects on human health. As the current sources of sterols and squalene are plant and shark oils, microalgae are suggested as more sustainable sources. Nonetheless, the high costs of production and processing still hinder the commercialization of algal cultivation. Strain improvement for higher product yield and tolerance to harsh environments is an attractive way to reduce costs. Being an intermediate in sterol synthesis, squalene is converted to squalene epoxide by squalene epoxidase. This step is inhibited by terbinafine, a commonly used antifungal drug. In yeasts, some terbinafine-resistant strains overproduced sterols, but similar microalgae strains have not been reported. Mutants that exhibit greater tolerance to terbinafine might accumulate increased sterols and squalene content, along with the ability to tolerate the drug and other stresses, which are beneficial for outdoor cultivation. To explore this possibility, terbinafine-resistant mutants were isolated in the model green microalga 
436	34438648	Reproductive Anatomy of Chondrichthyans: Notes on Specimen Handling and Sperm Extraction. II. Sharks and Chimaeras.	The chondrichthyan fishes, which comprise sharks, rays, and chimaeras, are one of the most threatened groups of vertebrates on the planet. Given this situation, an additional strategy for the protection of these species could be the ex situ conservation projects developed in public aquaria and research centers. Nevertheless, to increase sustainability and to develop properly in situ reintroduction strategies, captive breeding techniques, such as sperm extraction and artificial insemination, should be developed. These techniques are commonly used in other threatened species and could be also used in chondrichthyans. However, the different reproductive morphologies found in this group can complicate both processes. Therefore, a comparison of the reproductive anatomy of eight distinct chondrichthyans, with an emphasis on those important differences when performing sperm extraction or artificial insemination, is carried out herein. Sharks and chimaeras belonging to the Scyliorhinidae, Carcharhinidae, Centrophoridae, Etmopteridae, Hexanchidae, and Chimaeridae families were obtained from commercial fisheries, public aquaria, and stranding events. In addition, the process of obtaining viable sperm samples through cannulation, abdominal massage, and oviducal gland extraction is described in detail for both living and dead animals.
437	34438619	Vulnerability Assessment of Pelagic Sharks in the Western North Pacific by Using an Integrated Ecological Risk Assessment.	The vulnerability of 11 pelagic shark species caught by the Taiwanese coastal and offshore longline fisheries in the western North Pacific were assessed by an ecological risk assessment (ERA) and 10 of the 11 species was assessed by using an integrated ERA developed in this study. The intrinsic rate of population growth was used to estimate the productivity of sharks, and the susceptibility of sharks was estimated by the multiplication of the catchability, selectivity, and post-capture mortality. Three indices namely, the IUCN Red List category, the body weight variation trend, and the inflection point of population growth curve coupled with ERA were used to conduct an integrated ERA. The results indicated that the scalloped hammerhead is at the highest risk (group 1), followed by the silky shark, and the spinner shark at high risk (group 2). The bigeye thresher, and sandbar shark fall in group 3, the smooth hammerhead falls in group 4, and the shortfin mako, pelagic thresher, oceanic whitetip, and dusky shark fall in group 5. Rigorous management measures for the species in groups 1 and 2, setting total allowable catch quota for group 3, and consistent monitoring schemes for groups 4 and 5 are recommended.

440	34428223	Nation-wide assessment of the distribution and population size of the data-deficient nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum).	The study presents the first national assessment of a nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) population, conducted using a combination of transect surveys and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). Density of nurse sharks in Belize was found to be higher in reefs than in lagoons, and in the atolls furthest away from the mainland and human settlements. Only large and old protected areas were found to have a positive impact on nurse shark abundance. Absolute abundance of nurse sharks was estimated using distance sampling analysis, giving a total nurse shark population in the range of 3,858 to 14,375 sharks. Thanks to a vast area of suitable habitat for nurse sharks in the country and legislation already in place for the safeguard of the species, Belize could represent an important hotspot for nurse sharks in the Western Atlantic. The data presented here hence offers a baseline for the long-term monitoring of the Belizean nurse shark population and improves our understanding of nurse shark abundance and distribution in the wider Caribbean basin.
441	34425367	Bioaccumulation and biomagnification in elasmobranchs: A concurrent assessment of trophic transfer of trace elements in 12 species from the Indian Ocean.	We provided the first multi-species study investigating the presence and organotropism of trace elements in three tissues of 12 elasmobranch species. Shark species showed comparable TE loads, although milk sharks and juvenile scalloped hammerhead sharks exhibited the highest Cd and Hg levels, respectively. Fins accumulated higher levels of Pb, Co, and Cr; muscles higher V, As, and Hg; livers higher Se and Cd levels. The organotropism of TEs calls for cautious when choosing a tissue to be sampled since certain tissues, like fin clips, do not provide reliable surrogate for the internal loads of some TEs. Strong correlations between essential and toxic TEs indicated detoxification mechanisms, while the TMF provided evidence for Hg, As and Se biomagnification along the food-web. Considering the difficulties in assessing elasmobranchs contamination from different areas, the proposed multi-species approach represents a valuable way to estimate the species-specific accumulation and transfer of pollutants in sharks.
442	34424983	Accounting for body mass effects in the estimation of field metabolic rates from body acceleration.	Dynamic body acceleration (DBA), measured through animal-attached tags, has emerged as a powerful method for estimating field metabolic rates of free-ranging individuals. Following respirometry to calibrate oxygen consumption rate (ṀO2) with DBA under controlled conditions, predictive models can be applied to DBA data collected from free-ranging individuals. However, laboratory calibrations are generally performed on a relatively narrow size range of animals, which may introduce biases if predictive models are applied to differently sized individuals in the field. Here, we tested the mass dependence of the ṀO2-DBA relationship to develop an experimental framework for the estimation of field metabolic rates when organisms differ in size. We performed respirometry experiments with individuals spanning one order of magnitude in body mass (1.74-17.15 kg) and used a two-stage modelling process to assess the intraspecific scale dependence of the ṀO2-DBA relationship and incorporate such dependencies into the coefficients of ṀO2 predictive models. The final predictive model showed scale dependence; the slope of the ṀO2-DBA relationship was strongly allometric (M1.55), whereas the intercept term scaled closer to isometry (M1.08). Using bootstrapping and simulations, we evaluated the performance of this coefficient-corrected model against commonly used methods of accounting for mass effects on the ṀO2-DBA relationship and found the lowest error and bias in the coefficient-corrected approach. The strong scale dependence of the ṀO2-DBA relationship indicates that caution must be exercised when models developed using one size class are applied to individuals of different sizes.
444	34418091	Suspected predatory bites on a snorkeler by an oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus off Moorea island (French Polynesia).	Understanding why sharks bite humans is essential for developing strategies to prevent these incidents. Here, we use bite wound characteristics and eye witness descriptions of shark behavior to determine the likely motivation for several bites perpetrated by an oceanic whitetip (OWT) shark Carcharhinus longimanus on an adult female snorkeler off Moorea island (French Polynesia) in October 2019. The victim was snorkeling with others in pelagic waters as part of an organized whale-watching tour when the shark-without any warning behavior-bit her at least three times resulting in severe injuries with substantial loss of soft tissue from the chest and both forearms. The victim survived these injuries thanks to rapid and effective first aid provided by her companions. The sudden, unprovoked and repeated bites with substantial tissue removal are consistent with predatory behavior although the dominance hypothesis cannot be fully ruled out. This would be the first case of a predatory shark bite ever documented in French Polynesia in over 70 years of data collection. Given the routine association of OWT sharks with cetaceans, in-water whale watching activities should adopt appropriate risk management strategies in regions hosting this species of shark.
445	34411410	Evolution of lbx spinal cord expression and function.	Ladybird homeobox (Lbx) transcription factors have crucial functions in muscle and nervous system development in many animals. Amniotes have two Lbx genes, but only Lbx1 is expressed in spinal cord. In contrast, teleosts have three lbx genes and we show here that zebrafish lbx1a, lbx1b, and lbx2 are expressed by distinct spinal cell types, and that lbx1a is expressed in dI4, dI5, and dI6 interneurons, as in amniotes. Our data examining lbx expression in Scyliorhinus canicula and Xenopus tropicalis suggest that the spinal interneuron expression of zebrafish lbx1a is ancestral, whereas lbx1b has acquired a new expression pattern in spinal cord progenitor cells. lbx2 spinal expression was probably acquired in the ray-finned lineage, as this gene is not expressed in the spinal cords of either amniotes or S. canicula. We also show that the spinal function of zebrafish lbx1a is conserved with mouse Lbx1. In zebrafish lbx1a mutants, there is a reduction in the number of inhibitory spinal interneurons and an increase in the number of excitatory spinal interneurons, similar to mouse Lbx1 mutants. Interestingly, the number of inhibitory spinal interneurons is also reduced in lbx1b mutants, although in this case the number of excitatory interneurons is not increased. lbx1a;lbx1b double mutants have a similar spinal interneuron phenotype to lbx1a single mutants. Taken together these data suggest that lbx1b and lbx1a may be required in succession for correct specification of dI4 and dI6 spinal interneurons, although only lbx1a is required for suppression of excitatory fates in these cells.
446	34411303	Identification of the Fc-alpha/mu receptor in Xenopus provides insight into the emergence of the poly-Ig receptor (pIgR) and mucosal Ig transport.	"The polyimmunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transcytoses J chain-containing antibodies through mucosal epithelia. In mammals, two cis-duplicates of PIGR, FCMR, and FCAMR, flank the PIGR gene. A PIGR duplication is first found in amphibians, previously annotated as PIGR2 (herein xlFCAMR), and is expressed by APCs. We demonstrate that xlFcamR is the equivalent of mammalian FcamR. It has been assumed that pIgR is the oldest member of this family, yet our data could not distinguish whether PIGR or FCAMR emerged first; however, FCMR was the last family member to emerge. Interestingly, bony fish ""pIgR"" is not an orthologue of tetrapod pIgR, and possibly acquired its function via convergent evolution. PIGR/FCAMR/FCMR are members of a larger superfamily, including TREM, CD300, and NKp44, which we name the ""double-disulfide Ig superfamily"" (ddIgSF). Domains related to each ddIgSF family were identified in cartilaginous fish (sharks, chimeras) and encoded in a single gene cluster syntenic to the human pIgR locus. Thus, the ddIgSF families date back to the earliest antibody-based adaptive immunity, but apparently not before. Finally, our data strongly suggest that the J chain arose in evolution only for Ig multimerization. This study provides a framework for further studies of pIgR and the ddIgSF in vertebrates."
447	34409936	The whale shark genome reveals patterns of vertebrate gene family evolution.	Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes) are fundamental for understanding vertebrate evolution, yet their genomes are understudied. We report long-read sequencing of the whale shark genome to generate the best gapless chondrichthyan genome assembly yet with higher contig contiguity than all other cartilaginous fish genomes, and studied vertebrate genomic evolution of ancestral gene families, immunity, and gigantism. We found a major increase in gene families at the origin of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates) independent of their genome duplication. We studied vertebrate pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which are key in initiating innate immune defense, and found diverse patterns of gene family evolution, demonstrating that adaptive immunity in gnathostomes did not fully displace germline-encoded PRR innovation. We also discovered a new toll-like receptor (TLR29) and three NOD1 copies in the whale shark. We found chondrichthyan and giant vertebrate genomes had decreased substitution rates compared to other vertebrates, but gene family expansion rates varied among vertebrate giants, suggesting substitution and expansion rates of gene families are decoupled in vertebrate genomes. Finally, we found gene families that shifted in expansion rate in vertebrate giants were enriched for human cancer-related genes, consistent with gigantism requiring adaptations to suppress cancer.

449	34404844	The role and value of science in shark conservation advocacy.	Many species of sharks are threatened with extinction, and there has been a longstanding debate in scientific and environmental circles over the most effective and appropriate strategy to conserve and protect them. Should we allow for sustainable fisheries exploitation of species which can withstand fishing pressure, or ban all fisheries for sharks and trade in shark products? In the developing world, exploitation of fisheries resources can be essential to food security and poverty alleviation, and global management efforts are typically focused on sustainably maximizing economic benefits. This approach aligns with traditional fisheries management and the perspectives of most surveyed scientific researchers who study sharks. However, in Europe and North America, sharks are increasingly venerated as wildlife to be preserved irrespective of conservation status, resulting in growing pressure to prohibit exploitation of sharks and trade in shark products. To understand the causes and significance of this divergence in goals, we surveyed 155 shark conservation focused environmental advocates from 78 environmental non-profits, and asked three key questions: (1) where do advocates get scientific information? (2) Does all policy-relevant scientific information reach advocates? and (3) Do advocates work towards the same policy goals identified by scientific researchers? Findings suggest many environmental advocates are aware of key scientific results and use science-based arguments in their advocacy, but a small but vocal subset of advocates report that they never read the scientific literature or speak to scientists. Engagement with science appears to be a key predictor of whether advocates support sustainable management of shark fisheries or bans on shark fishing and trade in shark products. Conservation is a normative discipline, and this analysis more clearly articulates two distinct perspectives in shark conservation. Most advocates support the same evidence-based policies as academic and government scientists, while a smaller percentage are driven more by moral and ethical beliefs and may not find scientific research relevant or persuasive. We also find possible evidence that a small group of non-profits may be misrepresenting the state of the science while claiming to use science-based arguments, a concern that has been raised by surveyed scientists about the environmental community. This analysis suggests possible alternative avenues for engaging diverse stakeholders in productive discussions about shark conservation.
450	34403437	Application of biological and fisheries attributes to assess the vulnerability and resilience of tropical marine fish species.	Taking advantage of published data on life-history traits and short-term information on fishery parameters from 3132 records for 644 fish stocks along the coast of India, we calculated resilience (R) and vulnerability (V). Further, we developed an Index of Resilience and Vulnerability (IRV) for 133 species of tropical finfishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Using 7 resilience and 6 vulnerability attributes, two-dimensional scatter plots of the resilience and vulnerability scores were generated and the Euclidean distance and angle from the origin to each point were calculated to determine IRV and the effect of fishing on fish species. By ranking the species, the top 10 highly resilient, highly vulnerable, and high-risk species (low IRV) were identified. While small-sized species with fast growth rate and low trophic level were among the highly resilient species, large predatory species such as sharks and barracudas were among the highly vulnerable and high-risk species. More than 100 of the 133 species were resilient-yet-vulnerable, and most crustaceans showed high resilience. Differences in IRV scores among species within the same family were discernible, indicating the differences in the biological characteristics and response to fishing. Sensitivity analysis indicated that an abridged IRV with 6 attributes works similar to 13 attributes and can be used in data-deficient situations. Comparison of R and V of IRV with other assessments showed different results because of divergences in the objectives, number and types of attributes, and thresholds used. These assessments do not convey the same information and therefore great care must be taken for reproducing these frameworks to other fisheries. The results of IRV analysis can be useful for stock assessments and in developing effective management measures in combination with other complementary information.
451	34402530	A safe haven for potential reproductive aggregations of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish (Pseudobatos horkelii).	Brazilian endemic batoid elasmobranch populations have declined dramatically in the past 40 years due to anthropic activities (e.g., overfishing). The Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii, included in the IUCN red list of endangered species [Critically Endangered (CR)], has been captured as by-catch by trawling fishing boats to the edge of extinction. Despite governmental conservation initiatives, the species is still caught and commercialized along the Brazilian coast. In this study, the authors report three rare aggregation events for the Brazilian coast of P. horkelii, inside the only nearshore no-entry Brazilian marine protected area. Strategies for its protection are also discussed.

453	34382690	The elasmobranchs of Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Colombia.	Management and conservation actions in marine-protected areas require baselines for monitoring threatened marine fauna such as elasmobranchs. This article provides evidence of the occurrence of 34 species of elasmobranchs (21 sharks and 13 batoids) in the Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Colombia, including five new records of sharks and three of rays. From 1987 to 2021, new records were obtained by underwater visual census using SCUBA, manned submersibles and deep-ocean cameras to depths of up to 2211 m. Of the recorded species, 21 are considered as threatened taxa (64%) by the IUCN, making the Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary an essential conservation area for this highly threatened group of species.
454	34375335	Tooth morphology elucidates shark evolution across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction.	"Sharks (Selachimorpha) are iconic marine predators that have survived multiple mass extinctions over geologic time. Their prolific fossil record is represented mainly by isolated shed teeth, which provide the basis for reconstructing deep time diversity changes affecting different selachimorph clades. By contrast, corresponding shifts in shark ecology, as measured through morphological disparity, have received comparatively limited analytical attention. Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to comprehensively examine tooth morphologies in multiple shark lineages traversing the catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction-this event terminated the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago. Our results show that selachimorphs maintained virtually static levels of dental disparity in most of their constituent clades across the Cretaceous-Paleogene interval. Nevertheless, selective extinctions did impact apex predator species characterized by triangular blade-like teeth. This is particularly evident among lamniforms, which included the dominant Cretaceous anacoracids. Conversely, other groups, such as carcharhiniforms and orectolobiforms, experienced disparity modifications, while heterodontiforms, hexanchiforms, squaliforms, squatiniforms, and †synechodontiforms were not overtly affected. Finally, while some lamniform lineages disappeared, others underwent postextinction disparity increases, especially odontaspidids, which are typified by narrow-cusped teeth adapted for feeding on fishes. Notably, this increase coincides with the early Paleogene radiation of teleosts as a possible prey source, and the geographic relocation of disparity sampling ""hotspots,"" perhaps indicating a regionally disjunct extinction recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals a complex morphological response to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction and highlights an event that influenced the evolution of modern sharks."
455	34374783	Genomic Assessment of Global Population Structure in a Highly Migratory and Habitat Versatile Apex Predator, the Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier).	Understanding the population dynamics of highly mobile, widely distributed, oceanic sharks, many of which are overexploited, is necessary to aid their conservation management. We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (FST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (FST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the Hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective.
456	34371161	Morphological updates, host-specificity, molecular data and phylogenetic analysis of Acanthobothrium coronatum (Cestoda: Onchoproteocephalidea), a neglected parasite of the nursehound Scyliorhinus stellaris.	Acanthobothrium is the most speciose genus of onchoproteocephalidean cestodes, whose adults parasitize the intestine of elasmobranch fishes. Acanthobothrium coronatum, the type species of the genus described from Mediterranean elasmobranchs, remains a little known parasite, with the most recent reports dating back to the fifties. We hereby investigate host-specificity and redescribe A. coronatum from the same locality of its original description by using light and scanning electron microscopy approaches. Moreover, molecular and phylogenetic data inferred from the analysis of the 28S rDNA gene are reported for the first time. Out of the nine elasmobranch species examined from Gulf of Naples, we only detected A. coronatum in the intestine of Scyliorhinus stellaris, with infection patterns that supports evident host-specificity for this shark species. The genetic characterization of 28S rDNA showed 99.8-100% similarity with larvae previously found in Octopus vulgaris from the same area investigated here. Conspecificity between the present material and the larvae found in the octopus was also confirmed by the tree topology. The host-parasite phylogeny is discussed, even if additional molecular data are needed to clarify potential host-parasite patterns. Notwithstanding this limitation, this is the first molecular study revealing conspecificity between an adult Acanthobothrium species from a shark and the larvae found in an intermediate/paratenic host, shedding light on the transmission pathway of A. coronatum in S. stellaris. Finally, the taxonomic, molecular, and phylogenetic data presented here allow a better characterization of a neglected parasite.
457	34367554	Analytical methods matter too: Establishing a framework for estimating maximum metabolic rate for fishes.	Advances in experimental design and equipment have simplified the collection of maximum metabolic rate (MMR) data for a more diverse array of water-breathing animals. However, little attention has been given to the consequences of analytical choices in the estimation of MMR. Using different analytical methods can reduce the comparability of MMR estimates across species and studies and has consequences for the burgeoning number of macroecological meta-analyses using metabolic rate data. Two key analytical choices that require standardization are the time interval, or regression window width, over which MMR is estimated, and the method used to locate that regression window within the raw oxygen depletion trace. Here, we consider the effect of both choices by estimating MMR for two shark and two salmonid species of different activity levels using multiple regression window widths and three analytical methods: rolling regression, sequential regression, and segmented regression. Shorter regression windows yielded higher metabolic rate estimates, with a risk that the shortest windows (<1-min) reflect more system noise than MMR signal. Rolling regression was the best candidate model and produced the highest MMR estimates. Sequential regression models consistently produced lower relative estimates than rolling regression models, while the segmented regression model was unable to produce consistent MMR estimates across individuals. The time-point of the MMR regression window along the oxygen consumption trace varied considerably across individuals but not across models. We show that choice of analytical method, in addition to more widely understood experimental choices, profoundly affect the resultant estimates of MMR. We recommend that researchers (1) employ a rolling regression model with a reliable regression window tailored to their experimental system and (2) explicitly report their analytical methods, including publishing raw data and code.
458	34365159	Incidence of plastic ingestion by the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, off the northeast coast of Taiwan.	This present study documents the incidence of plastic digestion by shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), caught by the Taiwanese small-scale tuna longline fishery in the Northwest Pacific Ocean (between the northeast coast of Taiwan and Japan). In 20 stomachs of shortfin mako, nearly 10% of samples contained at least one piece of plastic debris. The ingested plastic debris was found in the forms of films (5.0 cm) and fragments (3.0 mm) and was identified as polypropylene (PP) based on its polymer characteristics. The results from the analysis provide evidence for the anthropogenic origin and potential intake pathway of direct engulfment of ingested plastics. Our results also confirmed the low incidence of plastic ingestion in shortfin mako, suggesting that pelagic marine species may be relatively less affected by plastic pollution. Future research efforts are thus needed to assess the long-term impact of plastic pollution on marine species.
459	34363233	The Establishment of an Optimal Protocol for Contrast-Enhanced Micro-Computed Tomography in the Cloudy Catshark Scyliorhinus torazame.	The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal imaging protocol for contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) using micro-CT (μ-CT) for the posterior cardinal vein (PCV), dorsal aorta (DA), hepatic portal vein (HPV), kidney, liver, cephalic arteries (CAs), and gills of Cloudy Catsharks Scyliorhinus torazame. Additionally, we examined the availability of CECT screening for the coelomic organs. Different doses of iopamidol (100, 300, 500, and 700 mg iodine [mgI]/kg) were administered intravenously for 20 s in six sharks. The CT scans from the pectoral girdle to the pelvic girdle were performed at 0-600 s after administration. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging of the CAs, gills, and coelomic organs was examined. Assessment of the signal enhancement value revealed that the PCV was easily visualized with all contrast doses at 25 s. The CAs, gills, and DA were visible at a slightly higher dose (CAs and gills: 200 mgI/kg at 40 s; DA: 300 mgI/kg at 50 s). The HPV was obvious at a dose of at least 500 mgI/kg after a 150-s delay. The parenchyma of the kidney had a contrast effect at 300 mgI/kg, 150 s after the contrast effect of the renal portal system disappeared. The liver, which stores a lot of lipids, had poor overall contrast enhancement that was optimized at the highest dose of 700 mgI/kg. Contrast-enhanced CT screening at 700 mgI/kg and 150 s is likely to obtain the optimal imaging of the reproductive organs, such as the ovary, oviducal gland, uterus, and testis. The present findings can be applied not only to clinical practice but also to academic research and education on elasmobranchs in aquariums.
461	34344492	Endocrine, Stemness, Proliferative, and Proteolytic Properties of Alarm Cells in Ruby-Red-Fin Shark (Rainbow Shark), Epalzeorhynchos frenatum (Teleostei: Cyprinidae).	The current study investigated the morphological, histochemical, and immunohistochemical characteristics of alarm cells and their precursors in ruby-red-fin shark (rainbow shark), Epalzeorhynchos frenatum (Teleostei: Cyprinidae). Precursor alarm cells were shown to be small, cuboidal, pyramidal, or round in shape, with eosinophilic cytoplasm, resting on the basement membrane of the epidermis. The cells later elongated to become columnar in shape. Subsequently, they enlarged and became large oval-shaped cells. They then underwent shrinkage and vacuolation. The superficial alarm cells were collapsed. Alarm cells were found to have an affinity for different histochemical stains, including bromophenol blue, iron hematoxylin, Sudan black, Mallory triple trichrome, Crossman's trichrome, Safranin O, and Weigert's stains, as well as lipase and alkaline phosphatase. Endocrine properties of the alarm cells were identified by silver staining and synaptophysin immunostaining. Alarm cells exhibited stemness activities and had a strong immunoaffinity for CD117. They had a proteolytic function, as identified by lysosome-specific staining with acridine orange and strong immunoaffinity for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9). They also exhibited proliferatively, reflected by immunological staining by proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In conclusion, alarm cells are unique epidermal cells with multiple functions. They play immunological, and endocrine, roles. They also retain stemness and proliferative properties.
462	34336480	Shark Fin Electrocardiogram: A Deadly Electrocardiogram Pattern in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).	Shark fin electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern, also known as 'Lambda-wave', 'giant R waves', or 'triangular QRS-ST-T waveform' is a dangerous ECG pattern associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is formed by the fusion of QRS, ST, and T waves and predicts the high risk of mortality due to cardiogenic shock and ventricular fibrillation. The management should be aggressive with reperfusion via thrombolysis or percutaneous intervention, ideally in the intensive care unit with ventricular assist devices. This ECG pattern may be misdiagnosed as wide complex tachycardia or the ECG changes of hyperkalemia. Thus, differentiating it from other conditions causing similar ECG changes and prompt management is highly important to save the patient from serious complications. Here we have presented a case of STEMI with shark fin ECG associated with pulmonary edema (Killip class III acute myocardial infarction).

464	34329051	Nurse sharks, space rockets and cargo ships: Metals and oxidative stress in a benthic, resident and large-sized mesopredator, Ginglymostoma cirratum.	It is widely recognized that apex predators, such as large sharks with highly migratory behavior, are particularly vulnerable to pollution, mainly due to biomagnification processes. However, in highly impacted areas, mesopredator sharks with resident behavior can be as vulnerable as apex sharks. In this context, this study evaluated cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and rubidium (Rb) concentrations, as well as the potentially protective effects of selenium (Se) and the behavior of two non-enzymatic biomarkers, metallothionein (MT) and reduced glutathione (GSH), employing the Atlantic nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum as a study model and compared the results with other resident benthic sharks, as well as highly mobile apex sharks. Muscle tissue samples from 28 nurse sharks opportunistically sampled from the Brazilian Amazon Coast were analyzed. Lower metal concentrations were observed for Pb, Rb and Se in the rainy season, while statistically significant correlations between metals were observed only between Hg and Cd and Pb and Se. Molar ratio calculations indicate potential protective Se effects against Pb, but not against Cd and Hg. No associations between MT and the determined metals were observed, indicating a lack of detoxification processes via the MT detoxification route. The same was noted for GSH, indicating no induction of this primary cellular antioxidant defense. Our results indicate that benthic/mesopredator sharks with resident behavior are, in fact, as impacted as highly mobile apex predators, with the traditional detoxification pathways seemingly inefficient for the investigated species. Moreover, considering the studied population and other literature data, pollution should be listed as a threat to the species in future risk assessments.
465	34328556	Physiological markers suggest energetic and nutritional adjustments in male sharks linked to reproduction.	Energetic condition is one of the most important factors that influence fitness and reproductive performance in vertebrates. Yet, we lack evidence on how energetic states change in response to reproduction in large marine vertebrates. In the present study, we used a non-lethal approach to assess relationships among reproductive stage, circulating steroid hormones (testosterone and relative corticosteroid levels), plasma fatty acids, and the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate in male sharks of two species with divergent ecologies, the benthic nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and the epipelagic blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus). We found higher relative corticosteroid levels in adult nurse sharks during the pre-mating period and in blacktip sharks during the mating period. Higher levels of β-hydroxybutyrate were found in adult nurse sharks during the mating period, but concentrations of this ketone body did not significantly vary across reproductive stages in blacktip sharks. We also detected reduced percentages of essential fatty acids during the mating period of both nurse and blacktip sharks. Taken together, our findings suggest that nurse and blacktip sharks differ in their energetic strategy to support reproduction, however, they likely rely on physiologically important fatty acids during mating, to support spermatogenesis.
466	34325655	Evolution of hes gene family in vertebrates: the hes5 cluster genes have specifically increased in frogs.	"BACKGROUND: hes genes are chordate homologs of Drosophila genes, hairy and enhancer of split, which encode a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor with a WRPW motif. Various developmental functions of hes genes, including early embryogenesis and neurogenesis, have been elucidated in vertebrates. However, their orthologous relationships remain unclear partly because of less conservation of relatively short amino acid sequences, the fact that the genome was not analyzed as it is today, and species-specific genome duplication. This results in complicated gene names in vertebrates, which are not consistent in orthologs. We previously revealed that Xenopus frogs have two clusters of hes5, named ""the hes5.1 cluster"" and ""the hes5.3 cluster"", but the origin and the conservation have not yet been revealed.
RESULTS: Here, we elucidated the orthologous and paralogous relationships of all hes genes of human, mouse, chicken, gecko, zebrafish, medaka, coelacanth, spotted gar, elephant shark and three species of frogs, Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis), X. laevis, Nanorana parkeri, by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. Any duplicated hes5 were not found in mammals, whereas hes5 clusters in teleost were conserved although not as many genes as the three frog species. In addition, hes5 cluster-like structure was found in the elephant shark genome, but not found in cyclostomata.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the hes5 cluster existed in the gnathostome ancestor but became a single gene in mammals. The number of hes5 cluster genes were specifically large in frogs."
467	34321530	Tracking the rising extinction risk of sharks and rays in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.	The loss of biodiversity is increasingly well understood on land, but trajectories of extinction risk remain largely unknown in the ocean. We present regional Red List Indices (RLIs) to track the extinction risk of 119 Northeast Atlantic and 72 Mediterranean shark and ray species primarily threatened by overfishing. We combine two IUCN workshop assessments from 2003/2005 and 2015 with a retrospective backcast assessment for 1980. We incorporate predicted categorisations for Data Deficient species from our previously published research. The percentage of threatened species rose from 1980 to 2015 from 29 to 41% (Northeast Atlantic) and 47 to 65% (Mediterranean Sea). There are as many threatened sharks and rays in Europe as there are threatened birds, but the threat level is nearly six times greater by percentage (41%, n = 56 of 136 vs. 7%, n = 56 of 792). The Northeast Atlantic RLI declined by 8% from 1980 to 2015, while the higher-risk Mediterranean RLI declined by 13%. Larger-bodied, shallow-distributed, slow-growing species and those with range boundaries within the region are more likely to have worsening status in the Northeast Atlantic. Conversely, long-established, severe threat levels obscure any potential relationships between species' traits and the likelihood of worsening IUCN status in the Mediterranean Sea. These regional RLIs provide the first widespread evidence for increasing trends in regional shark and ray extinction risk and underscore that effective fisheries management is necessary to recover the ecosystem function of these predators.
468	34320007	Basking shark sub-surface behaviour revealed by animal-towed cameras.	While biologging tags have answered a wealth of ecological questions, the drivers and consequences of movement and activity often remain difficult to ascertain, particularly marine vertebrates which are difficult to observe directly. Basking sharks, the second largest shark species in the world, aggregate in the summer in key foraging sites but despite advances in biologging technologies, little is known about their breeding ecology and sub-surface behaviour. Advances in camera technologies holds potential for filling in these knowledge gaps by providing environmental context and validating behaviours recorded with conventional telemetry. Six basking sharks were tagged at their feeding site in the Sea of Hebrides, Scotland, with towed cameras combined with time-depth recorders and satellite telemetry. Cameras recorded a cumulative 123 hours of video data over an average 64-hour deployment and confirmed the position of the sharks within the water column. Feeding events only occurred within a metre depth and made up ¾ of the time spent swimming near the surface. Sharks maintained similar tail beat frequencies regardless of whether feeding, swimming near the surface or the seabed, where they spent surprisingly up to 88% of daylight hours. This study reported the first complete breaching event and the first sub-surface putative courtship display, with nose-to-tail chasing, parallel swimming as well as the first observation of grouping behaviour near the seabed. Social groups of sharks are thought to be very short term and sporadic, and may play a role in finding breeding partners, particularly in solitary sharks which may use aggregations as an opportunity to breed. In situ observation of basking sharks at their seasonal aggregation site through animal borne cameras revealed unprecedented insight into the social and environmental context of basking shark behaviour which were previously limited to surface observations.
470	34310705	Eating catch of the day: the diet of porbeagle shark Lamna nasus (Bonnaterre 1788) based on stomach content analysis, and the interaction with trawl fisheries in the south-western Atlantic (52° S-56° S).	This work examined the diet of the porbeagle shark Lamna nasus in the south-west Atlantic Ocean (SWAO, Argentina, 52° S-56° S) by analysing the stomach content information obtained by scientific observers who sampled specimens captured as by-catch on-board commercial fishing vessels from 2010 to 2020. A total of 148 fishing sites were analysed, in which the estimated catch was composed mainly of hoki Macruronus magellanicus (56.00%) and southern blue whiting Micromesistius australis (33.13%). From 413 porbeagle sharks sampled (292 females and 121 males) ranging from 71 to 241 cm total length (L
471	34302843	Correlated evolution of fish host length and parasite spore size: a tale from myxosporeans inhabiting elasmobranchs.	Myxozoa represent a diverse group of microscopic cnidarian endoparasites alternating between invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Of the approximately 2,600 species described predominantly from teleost fish, only 1.8% have been reported from cartilaginous fishes (Elasmobranchii). As ancestral vertebrate hosts of myxozoans, elasmobranchs may have played an important role in myxozoan evolution, however, they are also some of the largest vertebrate hosts known for this group of parasites. We screened 50 elasmobranchs belonging to nine species and seven families, from various geographical areas, for myxozoan infection. We found a 22% overall prevalence of myxozoans in elasmobranchs and describe five species new to science. We investigated, for the first known time, the evolution of spore size within three phylogenetic clades, Ceratomyxa, Sphaerospora sensu stricto and Parvicapsula. We found that spores from elasmobranch-infecting myxozoans were on average 4.8× (Ceratomyxa), 2.2× (Parvicapsula clade) and 1.8× (Sphaerospora sensu stricto except polysporoplasmic Sphaerospora spp.) larger than those from teleosts. In all analysed clades, spore size was correlated with phylogenetic position. In ceratomyxids, it was further strongly positively correlated with fish body size and habitat depth, independent of cellular composition of the spores and phylogenetic position in the tree. While in macroparasites a host size-correlated increase in parasite size occurs on a large scale and is often related to improved exploitation of host resources, in microscopic parasites size ranges vary at the scale of a few micrometres, disproportionate to the available additional space in a large host. We discuss the ecological role of these changes with regard to transmission under high pressure and an invertebrate fauna that is adapted to deeper marine habitats.
472	34301952	Reconstruction of proto-vertebrate, proto-cyclostome and proto-gnathostome genomes provides new insights into early vertebrate evolution.	Ancient polyploidization events have had a lasting impact on vertebrate genome structure, organization and function. Some key questions regarding the number of ancient polyploidization events and their timing in relation to the cyclostome-gnathostome divergence have remained contentious. Here we generate de novo long-read-based chromosome-scale genome assemblies for the Japanese lamprey and elephant shark. Using these and other representative genomes and developing algorithms for the probabilistic macrosynteny model, we reconstruct high-resolution proto-vertebrate, proto-cyclostome and proto-gnathostome genomes. Our reconstructions resolve key questions regarding the early evolutionary history of vertebrates. First, cyclostomes diverged from the lineage leading to gnathostomes after a shared tetraploidization (1R) but before a gnathostome-specific tetraploidization (2R). Second, the cyclostome lineage experienced an additional hexaploidization. Third, 2R in the gnathostome lineage was an allotetraploidization event, and biased gene loss from one of the subgenomes shaped the gnathostome genome by giving rise to remarkably conserved microchromosomes. Thus, our reconstructions reveal the major evolutionary events and offer new insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrate genomes.

474	34298180	Red and white muscle proportions and enzyme activities in mesopelagic sharks.	In the last decade, there has been an increase in the study of the ecology of deep-sea organisms. One way to understand an organism's ecology is the study of its metabolism. According to literature, deep-sea sharks possess a lower anaerobic enzyme activity than their shallow-water counterparts, but no difference has been observed regarding their aerobic enzyme activities. These studies have suggested deep-sea sharks should be slow and listless swimmers. However, other studies based on video observations have revealed differences in cruise swimming speed between different species. The present study examined muscles of squaliform sharks, including both luminous and non-luminous species. We combined measurements of the relative amounts of red and white muscle with assays of enzymes that are used as markers for aerobic (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase) and anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase) metabolism, searching for a relationship with cruising speeds. Non-luminous deep-sea species displayed lower aerobic enzyme activities but similar anaerobic enzyme activities than the benthic shallow-water counterpart (Squalus acanthias). Conversely, luminous Etmopteridae species were found to have similar aerobic enzyme activities to S. acanthias but displayed lower anaerobic enzyme activities. Analyses revealed that red muscle proportion and aerobic enzyme activities were positively related to the cruise swimming speed. In contrast, Dalatias licha, which swims at the slowest cruise swimming speed ever recorded, presented a very low aerobic metabolic phenotype (lower aerobic marker enzymes and less red muscle). Finally, the values obtained for white muscle proportion and anaerobic metabolic phenotype suggested a high burst capacity for D. licha and non-luminous sharks.
475	34294756	International﻿ fisheries threaten globally endangered sharks in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean: the case of the Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999 reefer vessel seized within the Galápagos Marine Reserve.	Shark fishing, driven by the fin trade, is the primary cause of global shark population declines. Here, we present a case study that exemplifies how industrial fisheries are likely depleting shark populations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean. In August 2017, the vessel Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999, of Chinese flag, was detained while crossing through the Galápagos Marine Reserve without authorization. This vessel contained 7639 sharks, representing one of the largest seizures recorded to date. Based on a sample of 929 individuals (12%), we found 12 shark species: 9 considered as Vulnerable or higher risk by the IUCN and 8 listed in CITES. Four species showed a higher proportion of immature than mature individuals, whereas size-distribution hints that at least some of the fishing ships associated with the operation may have been using purse-seine gear fishing equipment, which, for some species, goes against international conventions. Our data expose the magnitude of the threat that fishing industries and illegal trade represent to sharks in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean.
476	34291561	Reef communities show predictable undulations in linear abundance size spectra from copepods to sharks.	Among the more widely accepted general hypotheses in ecology is that community relationships between abundance and body size follow a log-linear size spectrum, from the smallest consumers to the largest predators (i.e. 'bacteria to whales'). Nevertheless, most studies only investigate small subsets of this spectrum, and note that extreme size classes in survey data deviate from linear expectations. In this study, we fit size spectra to field data from 45 rocky and coral reef sites along a 28° latitudinal gradient, comprising individuals from 0.125 mm to 2 m in body size. We found that 96% of the variation in abundance along this 'extended' size gradient was described by a single linear function across all sites. However, consistent 'wobbles' were also observed, with subtle peaks and troughs in abundance along the spectrum, which varied with sea temperature, as predicted by theory relating to trophic cascades.
477	34290347	"Understanding of remora's ""hitchhiking"" behaviour from a hydrodynamic point of view."	Symbiotic relationships have developed through natural evolution. For example, that of the remora fish attached to the body of a shark. From the remora's perspective, this could be associated to an increased hydrodynamic efficiency in swimming and this needs to be investigated. To understand the remora's swimming strategy in the attachment state, a systematic study has been conducted using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, STAR-CCM + to analyse and compare the resistance characteristics of the remora in attached swimming conditions. Two fundamental questions are addressed: what is the effect of the developed boundary layer flow and the effect of the adverse pressure gradient on the remora's hydrodynamic characteristics? According to the results, the resistance of the remora can generally be halved when attached. Besides, the results have also demonstrated that the drag reduction rate increases with the developed boundary layer thickness and can be estimated using the boundary layer thickness ratio and velocity deficit. The paper demonstrates that the most frequent attachment locations are also the areas that provide the maximum drag reduction rate.
478	34290296	Brown banded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) shows high genetic diversity and differentiation in Malaysian waters.	The demersal brown banded bamboo shark Chiloscyllium punctatum is a major component of sharks landed in Malaysia. However, little is known about their population structure and the effect of high fishing pressure on these weak swimming sharks. Both mitochondrial DNA control region (1072 bp) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (1044 bp) were used to elucidate the genetic structure and connectivity of C. punctatum among five major areas within the Sundaland region. Our findings revealed (i) strong genetic structure with little present day mixing between the major areas, (ii) high intra-population genetic diversity with unique haplotypes, (iii) significant correlation between genetic differentiation and geographical distance coupled with detectable presence of fine scale geographical barriers (i.e. the South China Sea), (iv) historical directional gene flow from the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia towards the west coast and Borneo, and (v) no detectable genetic differentiation along the coastline of east Peninsular Malaysia. Genetic patterns inferred from the mitochondrial DNA loci were consistent with the strong coastal shelf association in this species, the presence of contemporary barriers shaped by benthic features, and limited current-driven egg dispersal. Fine scale population structure of C. punctatum highlights the need to improve genetic understanding for fishery management and conservation of other small-sized sharks.
479	34289517	Testing a global standard for quantifying species recovery and assessing conservation impact.	"Recognizing the imperative to evaluate species recovery and conservation impact, in 2012 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) called for development of a ""Green List of Species"" (now the IUCN Green Status of Species). A draft Green Status framework for assessing species' progress toward recovery, published in 2018, proposed 2 separate but interlinked components: a standardized method (i.e., measurement against benchmarks of species' viability, functionality, and preimpact distribution) to determine current species recovery status (herein species recovery score) and application of that method to estimate past and potential future impacts of conservation based on 4 metrics (conservation legacy, conservation dependence, conservation gain, and recovery potential). We tested the framework with 181 species representing diverse taxa, life histories, biomes, and IUCN Red List categories (extinction risk). Based on the observed distribution of species' recovery scores, we propose the following species recovery categories: fully recovered, slightly depleted, moderately depleted, largely depleted, critically depleted, extinct in the wild, and indeterminate. Fifty-nine percent of tested species were considered largely or critically depleted. Although there was a negative relationship between extinction risk and species recovery score, variation was considerable. Some species in lower risk categories were assessed as farther from recovery than those at higher risk. This emphasizes that species recovery is conceptually different from extinction risk and reinforces the utility of the IUCN Green Status of Species to more fully understand species conservation status. Although extinction risk did not predict conservation legacy, conservation dependence, or conservation gain, it was positively correlated with recovery potential. Only 1.7% of tested species were categorized as zero across all 4 of these conservation impact metrics, indicating that conservation has, or will, play a role in improving or maintaining species status for the vast majority of these species. Based on our results, we devised an updated assessment framework that introduces the option of using a dynamic baseline to assess future impacts of conservation over the short term to avoid misleading results which were generated in a small number of cases, and redefines short term as 10 years to better align with conservation planning. These changes are reflected in the IUCN Green Status of Species Standard."
480	34288119	Phylogeny-based conservation priorities for Australian freshwater fishes.	Conservation scientists are increasingly interested in the question of how extinction prunes the tree of life. This question is particularly important for Australian freshwater fishes because there is a broad mix of ∼300 old and young species, many of which are severely threatened. We used a complete species-level phylogeny of Australian freshwater fishes to examine phylogenetic nonrandomness of extinction risk. We computed the potential loss of phylogenetic diversity by simulating extinction across the tree under a pattern weighted based on International Union for Conservation of Nature extinction risk category and compared this loss to projected diversity loss under a random null model of extinction. Finally, we calculated EDGE (evolutionary distinctiveness, global endangerment) scores for 251 freshwater and 60 brackish species and compiled a list of high-priority species for conservation actions based on their extinction risk and evolutionary uniqueness. Extinction risk was not random and was clustered in both diversity cradles (recently diversifying, species-rich clades, such as Galaxiidae and Percichthyidae) and museums (older, species-poor groups, such as freshwater chondrichthyans). Clustered extinction made little difference to the average expected loss of phylogenetic diversity. However, the upper bound of loss was higher under a selective model of extinction, particularly when the counts of species lost were low. Thus, the loss of highly threatened species would diminish the tree of life more than a null model of randomly distributed extinction.  High priority species included both widely recognized and charismatic ones, such as the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), river sharks, and freshwater sawfishes, and lesser-known species that receive less public attention, including the salamanderfish (Lepidogalaxias salamandroides), cave gudgeons, and many galaxiids, rainbowfishes, and pygmy perches.
481	34286850	Development and successful real-world use of a transfer DNA technique to identify species involved in shark bite incidents.	Identifying the species involved in shark bite incidents is an ongoing challenge but is important to mitigate risk. We developed a sampling protocol to identify shark species from DNA transferred to inanimate objects during bite incidents. To develop and refine the technique, we swabbed shark bite impressions on surfboards and wetsuit neoprene collected under semicontrolled conditions. Methods were tested experimentally and then successfully used to identify the species involved in a real-world shark bite incident. Thirty-two of 33 bite impressions yielded sufficient DNA sequences for species identification, producing barcodes from five test species, including dusky, Galapagos, bull, tiger, and white shark. The latter three species collectively account for a majority of shark bites worldwide. Our method successfully identified the species (Galeocerdo cuvier) responsible for a fatal shark bite on December 8th, 2020 on the island of Maui, from swab samples collected from the victim's surfboard 49 h after the bite incident. Our experimental results demonstrate that shark species can be accurately identified from transfer DNA recovered from bite impressions on surfboards and wetsuit neoprene. The successful use of our method in the real-world incident shows great potential for the practicality of this tool. We recommend DNA swabbing as a routine part of the forensic analysis of shark bites to help identify the species involved in human-shark interactions.
482	34285330	Social familiarity improves fast-start escape performance in schooling fish.	Using social groups (i.e. schools) of the tropical damselfish Chromis viridis, we test how familiarity through repeated social interactions influences fast-start responses, the primary defensive behaviour in a range of taxa, including fish, sharks, and larval amphibians. We focus on reactivity through response latency and kinematic performance (i.e. agility and propulsion) following a simulated predator attack, while distinguishing between first and subsequent responders (direct response to stimulation versus response triggered by integrated direct and social stimulation, respectively). In familiar schools, first and subsequent responders exhibit shorter latency than unfamiliar individuals, demonstrating that familiarity increases reactivity to direct and, potentially, social stimulation. Further, familiarity modulates kinematic performance in subsequent responders, demonstrated by increased agility and propulsion. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of social recognition and memory may enhance individual fitness through greater survival of predator attacks.
483	34284626	Shark spiral intestines may operate as Tesla valves.	Looking to nature for inspiration has led to many diverse technological advances. The spiral valve intestine of sharks has provided the opportunity to observe the efficiency of different valve systems. It is supposed that the spiral intestine present in sharks, skates and rays slows the transit rate of digesta through the gut and provides increased surface area for the absorption of nutrients. In this investigation, we use a novel technique-creating three-dimensional reconstructions from CT scans of spiral intestines-to describe the morphology of the spiral intestine of at least one species from 22 different shark families. We discuss the morphological data in an evolutionary, dietary and functional context. The evolutionary analyses suggest that the columnar morphology is the ancestral form of the spiral intestine. Dietary analyses reveal no correlation between diet type and spiral intestine morphology. Flow rate was slowed significantly more when the two funnel-shaped spiral intestines were subjected to flow in the posterior to anterior direction, indicating their success at producing unidirectional flow, similar to a Tesla valve. These data are available to generate additional three-dimensional morphometrics, create computational models of the intestine, as well as to further explore the function of the gastrointestinal tract of sharks in structural and physiological contexts.
484	34275822	Comparative antioxidant and analgesic effect of sesame oil, fish oil and their combination in experimental animal model.	Natural oils are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFs) like omega 3, omega 6 and other nutrients that boost physical and mental health. Traditionally these oils have been used to treat joint pain associated with several inflammatory conditions. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant and analgesic properties of the sesame oil (SO), fish oil (FO) and combination of these two oils (SO+FO). Different concentrations of the SO, FO and SO+FO combination 0.02-4mg/ml were used for assessing the free radical scavenging activity by DPPH method and the IC50 value was calculated. Acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test, tail immersion and hot plate models were used to determined analgesic effect. Results showed that both oils were well tolerated as no signs of toxicity or death were noticed during the observational study period. SO+FO combination showed the best antioxidant properties as shown by DPPH assay. Similarly in analgesic models, SO and FO significantly reduced the number of abdominal contractions (p<0.05) however, SO+FO (1:1) exhibited highly significant results (p<0.001) in writhing reflex test. Furthermore, SO and FO both increased the reaction time on a hot plate as well as in tail flick test (p<0.05) whereas, SO+FO significantly increased reaction time (p<0.001) in hot plate and in tail flick test as compared to SO and FO single treatments. Conclusively, our results suggest that the combination of both oils (SO+FO) exhibited significant antioxidant and analgesic potential that it could be considered as one of the active combinations for relieving pain in adjunctive treatment for joint pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
485	34272657	Complete genome sequences of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus isolated from farmed albino rainbow sharks Epalzeorhynchos frenatum in the United States.	The genus Megalocytivirus includes viruses known to cause significant disease in aquacultured fish stocks. Herein, we report the complete genome sequences of two megalocytiviruses (MCVs) isolated from diseased albino rainbow sharks Epalzeorhynchos frenatum reared on farms in the United States in 2018 and 2019. Histopathological examination revealed typical megalocytivirus microscopic lesions (i.e., basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions) that were most commonly observed in the spleen and kidney. Transmission electron microscopic examination of spleen and kidney tissues from specimens of the 2018 case revealed hexagonally shaped virus particles with a mean diameter of 153 ± 6 nm (n = 20) from opposite vertices and 131 ± 5 nm (n = 20) from opposite faces. Two MCV-specific conventional PCR assays confirmed the presence of MCV DNA in the collected samples. Full genome sequencing of both 2018 and 2019 Epalzeorhynchos frenatus iridoviruses (EFIV) was accomplished using a next-generation sequencing approach. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that both EFIV isolates belong to the infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) genotype within the genus Megalocytivirus. This study is the first report of ISKNV in albino rainbow sharks.
486	34270092	Residency and movement patterns of adult Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) at a breeding aggregation site.	Examining the movement ecology of mesopredators is fundamental to developing an understanding of their biology, ecology and behaviour, as well as the communities and ecosystems they influence. The limited research on the residency and movements of benthic marine mesopredators has primarily used visual tags, which do not allow for the efficient and accurate monitoring of individual space use. In this study, the authors investigated the residency and movement patterns of Port Jackson sharks Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Meyer 1793) at a breeding aggregation site in Jervis Bay, south-eastern Australia, using passive acoustic telemetry to further our understanding of the movement ecology of these important mesopredators. Between 2012 and 2014, individuals were tagged with acoustic transmitters, and their residency and movements within the bay were monitored for up to 4 years. H. portusjacksoni showed strong preferences for particular reefs within and between breeding seasons. Males had significantly higher residency indices at their favoured sites relative to females, suggesting that males may be engaging in territorial behaviour. Conversely, female H. portusjacksoni exhibited higher roaming indices relative to males indicating that females may move between sites to assess males. Finally, H. portusjacksoni showed temporal variation in movements between reefs with individuals typically visiting more reefs at night relative to the day, dusk and dawn corresponding with their nocturnal habits.
488	34267213	Mechanism for enhancing the growth of mung bean seedlings under simulated microgravity.	To elucidate a mechanism for enhancing mung bean seedlings' growth under microgravity conditions, we measured growth, gene expression, and enzyme activity under clinorotation (20 rpm), and compared data obtained to those grown under normal gravity conditions (control). An increase in fresh weight, water content, and lengths were observed in the clinostat seedlings, compared to those of the control seedlings. Real-time PCR showed that aquaporin expression and the amylase gene were upregulated under clinorotation. Additionally, seedlings under clinorotation exhibited a significantly higher amylase activity. Near-infrared image showed that there was no restriction of water evaporation from the seedlings under clinorotation. Therefore, these results indicate that simulated microgravity could induce water uptake, resulting in enhanced amylase activity and seedling growth. Upregulated aquaporin expression could be the first trigger for enhanced growth under clinorotation. We speculated that the seedlings under clinorotation do not use energy against gravitational force and consumed surplus energy for enhanced growth.
489	34264979	Taphonomy of marine vertebrates of the Pisco Formation (Miocene, Peru): Insights into the origin of an outstanding Fossil-Lagerstätte.	The Miocene Pisco Formation, broadly exposed in the Ica Desert of southern Peru, is among the most outstanding Cenozoic marine Fossil-Lagerstätten worldwide. It is renowned for its exceptional preservation and abundance of vertebrate fossils, including a rich assemblage of whales and dolphins (Cetacea). Here, we integrate taphonomic data on 890 marine vertebrate fossils, gathered through 16 different localities. Our observations range from the taxonomic distribution, articulation, completeness, disposition and orientation of skeletons, to the presence of bite marks, associations with shark teeth and macro-invertebrates, bone and soft tissue preservation, and the formation of attendant carbonate concretions and sedimentary structures. We propose that the exceptional preservation characterising many Pisco vertebrates, as well as their exceptionally high abundance, cannot be ascribed to a single cause like high sedimentation rates (as proposed in the past), but rather to the interplay of several favourable factors including: (i) low levels of dissolved oxygen at the seafloor (with the intervention of seasonal anoxic events); (ii) the early onset of mineralisation processes like apatite dissolution/recrystallisation and carbonate mineral precipitation; (iii) rapid burial of carcasses in a soupy substrate and/or a novel mechanism involving scour-induced self-burial; and (iv) original biological richness. Collectively, our observations provide a comprehensive overview of the taphonomic processes that shaped one of South America's most important fossil deposits, and suggest a model for the formation of other marine vertebrate Fossil-Lagerstätten.
490	34260419	Wound Care Consultation in Postacute/Long-term Care: Characteristics and Practice Implications.	"OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of residents in postacute (PA)/long-term care (LTC) facilities with wounds and prevalence of wound types other than pressure injuries (PIs).
METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of all wound care consultations over 1 year at The New Jewish Home, a 514-bed academically affiliated facility in an urban setting. Investigators analyzed residents by age, sex, type of wound, presence of infection, and whether the resident was PA or LTC. Authors designated PIs as facility acquired or present on admission.
RESULTS: During the study period, 190 wound care consultations were requested; 74.7% of consults were for those in PA care. The average patient age was 76.3 years, and there were 1.7 wounds per resident receiving consultation. Of studied wounds, 53.2% were PIs, 15.8% surgical, 6.8% arterial, 6.3% soft tissue injury, 5.8% venous, 2.6% malignant wounds, and 2.1% diabetic ulcers; however, 11.6% of residents receiving consults had more than one wound type. In this sample, 13.2% of residents had infected wounds, and 76.2% of PIs were present on admission.
CONCLUSIONS: The wide variety of wounds in this sample reflects the medical complexity of this population. The transformation of LTC into a PA environment has altered the epidemiology of chronic wounds and increased demand for wound care expertise. These results challenge traditional perceptions of wound care centered on PIs. Given its importance, a wound care skill set should be required of all PA/LTC providers."
494	34252101	Two species, one island: Retrospective analysis of threatened fauna translocations with divergent outcomes.	Translocations are globally a popular tool used with the intention of improving threatened species conservation and re-establishing ecosystem function. While practitioners strive for successful outcomes the failure rate of translocations continues to be high. We demonstrate how predictive modelling can contribute to more informed decision making and hence potentially improve the success rate of translocation programs. Two species, the Djoongari (Shark Bay mouse) Pseudomys fieldi and the golden bandicoot Isoodon auratus barrowensis, were introduced independently to Doole Island in the Exmouth Gulf of Western Australia. We used population viability analysis to critique the outcomes of these translocations and provide an example of how this tool can be incorporated with expert knowledge to predict likely outcomes of translocations. Djoongari did not establish on the island after seven translocations over nine years, while golden bandicoots established a population after just one release event. Retrospective population viability analysis (of data that was unavailable prior to the translocations) predicted and clarified the reasons behind the outcomes of both translocations. Golden bandicoots have considerably higher demographic plasticity than Djoongari, which were never likely to establish on the island. We conclude that the failure of the Djoongari translocation was due to interactions between sparse habitat, native predators and cyclonic storm surges, whereas golden bandicoots have demonstrated habitat flexibility and an ability to recover from multiple natural disasters. As a result we (1) remind conservation planners of the importance of quantifying likely refuges and habitat availability at release sites, (2) suggest practitioners consider how different threats (including natural disasters) may interact at potential release sites and (3) advocate for the incorporation of predictive modelling during the planning stages of translocations, particularly for conservation introductions where no precedent exists for the species' survival at a particular location.
496	34244536	Recent expansion of marine protected areas matches with home range of grey reef sharks.	Dramatic declines in reef shark populations have been documented worldwide in response to human activities. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) offer a useful mechanism to protect these species and their roles in coral reef ecosystems. The effectiveness of MPAs notably relies on compliance together with sufficient size to encompass animal home range. Here, we measured home range of 147 grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, using acoustic telemetry in New Caledonia. The distribution of home range was then compared to local MPA sizes. We report a home range of 12 km
497	34237466	Ancient fishes and the functional evolution of the corticosteroid stress response in vertebrates.	The neuroendocrine mechanism underlying stress responses in vertebrates is hypothesized to be highly conserved and evolutionarily ancient. Indeed, elements of this mechanism, from the brain to steroidogenic tissue, are present in all vertebrate groups; yet, evidence of the function and even identity of some elements of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) axis is equivocal among the most basal vertebrates. The purpose of this review is to discuss the functional evolution of the HPA/I axis in vertebrates with a focus on our understanding of this neuroendocrine mechanism in the most ancient vertebrates: the agnathan (i.e., hagfish and lamprey) and chondrichthyan fishes (i.e., sharks, rays, and chimeras). A review of the current literature presents evidence of a conserved HPA/I axis in jawed vertebrates (i.e., gnathostomes); yet, available data in jawless (i.e., agnathan) and chondrichthyan fishes are limited. Neuroendocrine regulation of corticosteroidogenesis in agnathans and chondrichthyans appears to function through similar pathways as in bony fishes and tetrapods; however, key elements have yet to be identified and the involvement of melanotropins and gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the stress axis in these ancient fishes warrants further investigation. Further, the identities of physiological glucocorticoids are uncertain in hagfishes, chondrichthyans, and even coelacanths. Resolving these and other knowledge gaps in the stress response of ancient fishes will be significant for advancing knowledge of the evolutionary origins of the vertebrate stress response.
501	34232316	Too big to study? The biologging approach to understanding the behavioural energetics of ocean giants.	Wild animals are under selective pressure to optimise energy budgets; therefore, quantifying energy expenditure, intake and allocation to specific activities is important if we are to understand how animals survive in their environment. One approach toward estimating energy budgets has involved measuring oxygen consumption rates under controlled conditions and constructing allometric relationships across species. However, studying 'giant' marine vertebrates (e.g. pelagic sharks, whales) in this way is logistically difficult or impossible. An alternative approach involves the use of increasingly sophisticated electronic tags that have allowed recordings of behaviour, internal states and the surrounding environment of marine animals. This Review outlines how we could study the energy expenditure and intake of free-living ocean giants using this 'biologging' technology. There are kinematic, physiological and theoretical approaches for estimating energy expenditure, each of which has merits and limitations. Importantly, tag-derived energy proxies can hardly be validated against oxygen consumption rates for giant species. The proxies are thus qualitative, rather than quantitative, estimates of energy expenditure, and have more limited utilities. Despite this limitation, these proxies allow us to study the energetics of ocean giants in their behavioural context, providing insight into how these animals optimise their energy budgets under natural conditions. We also outline how information on energy intake and foraging behaviour can be gained from tag data. These methods are becoming increasingly important owing to the natural and anthropogenic environmental changes faced by ocean giants that can alter their energy budgets, fitness and, ultimately, population sizes.
502	34230097	Fossil dermal denticles reveal the preexploitation baseline of a Caribbean coral reef shark community.	Preexploitation shark baselines and the history of human impact on coral reef-associated shark communities in the Caribbean are tpoorly understood. We recovered shark dermal denticles from mid-Holocene (∼7 ky ago) and modern reef sediments in Bocas del Toro, Caribbean Panama, to reconstruct an empirical shark baseline before major human impact and to quantify how much the modern shark community in the region had shifted from this historical reference point. We found that denticle accumulation rates, a proxy for shark abundance, declined by 71% since the mid-Holocene. All denticle morphotypes, which reflect shark community composition, experienced significant losses, but those morphotypes found on fast-swimming, pelagic sharks (e.g., families Carcharhinidae and Sphyrnidae) declined the most. An analysis of historical records suggested that the steepest decline in shark abundance occurred in the late 20th century, coinciding with the advent of a targeted shark fishery in Panama. Although the disproportionate loss of denticles characterizing pelagic sharks was consistent with overfishing, the large reduction in denticles characterizing demersal species with low commercial value (i.e., the nurse shark 
503	34229487	Temporal niche partitioning as a novel mechanism promoting co-existence of sympatric predators in marine systems.	Niche partitioning of time, space or resources is considered the key to allowing the coexistence of competitor species, and particularly guilds of predators. However, the extent to which these processes occur in marine systems is poorly understood due to the difficulty in studying fine-scale movements and activity patterns in mobile underwater species. Here, we used acceleration data-loggers to investigate temporal partitioning in a guild of marine predators. Six species of co-occurring large coastal sharks demonstrated distinct diel patterns of activity, providing evidence of strong temporal partitioning of foraging times. This is the first instance of diel temporal niche partitioning described in a marine predator guild, and is probably driven by a combination of physiological constraints in diel timing of activity (e.g. sensory adaptations) and interference competition (hierarchical predation within the guild), which may force less dominant predators to suboptimal foraging times to avoid agonistic interactions. Temporal partitioning is often thought to be rare compared to other partitioning mechanisms, but the occurrence of temporal partitioning here and similar characteristics in many other marine ecosystems (multiple predators simultaneously present in the same space with dietary overlap) introduces the question of whether this is a common mechanism of resource division in marine systems.
504	34225838	The Distribution Profile of Glycoconjugates in the Testis of Brown-Banded Bamboo Shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) by Using Lectin Histochemistry.	The testis of bamboo shark is characterized by diametric development leading to zonation architecture. Here, we investigated the staining pattern of 12 lectins in 6 groups of differential binding specificities within the germ, somatic, and interstitial cells of each zone. The neutral mucopolysaccharides appeared in the interstitial tissue in all the zones and became more significant in the spermatozoal–Sertoli cell junction. The cellular localization of the lectins varies in testicular zones and cell types. There was a gradual increase in glycosylation toward the degenerative zone. The increased intensity of most lectins in the interstitial cells indicates the association of glycoconjugates in their androgen-secreting activity. Statistical analyses showed a significant correlation between the groups of lectins and each lectin used, stronger response to lectins in the interstitial cells (ICs) than other cell types. Moreover, the response to glucosamine (GlcNAc), galactosamine (GalNAc), and fucose tended to be higher than glucose and galactose. Furthermore, the intensity of response was increased toward the degenerative zone. In addition, we can use peanut agglutinin (PNA) as an acrosomal marker in combination with other marker proteins for studying shark spermatogenesis. These findings refer to the crucial role of glycoconjugates in spermatogenesis in the bamboo shark testis.
505	34222817	Probing the Ecology and Climate of the Eocene Southern Ocean With Sand Tiger Sharks Striatolamia macrota.	Many explanations for Eocene climate change focus on the Southern Ocean-where tectonics influenced oceanic gateways, ocean circulation reduced heat transport, and greenhouse gas declines prompted glaciation. To date, few studies focus on marine vertebrates at high latitudes to discern paleoecological and paleoenvironmental impacts of this climate transition. The Tertiary Eocene La Meseta (TELM) Formation has a rich fossil assemblage to characterize these impacts; 
506	34217058	Forensic genetic identification of sharks involved in human attacks.	Each year, 75-100 unprovoked shark attacks on humans are recorded, most of them resulting in no or minor injuries, while a few are fatal. Often, shark identification responsible for attacks relies on visual observations or bite wound characteristics, which limits species determination and preclude individual identification. Here, we provide two genetic approaches to reliably identify species and/or individuals involved in shark attacks on humans based on a non-invasive DNA sampling (i.e. DNA traces present on bite wounds on victims), depending on the knowledge of previous attack history at the site. The first approach uses barcoding techniques allowing species identification without any a priori, while the second relies on microsatellite genotyping, allowing species identification confirmation and individual identification, but requiring an a priori of the potential species involved in the attack. Both approaches were validated by investigating two shark attacks that occurred in Reunion Island (southwestern Indian Ocean). According to both methods, each incident was attributed to a bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), in agreement with suggestions derived from bite wound characteristics. Both approaches appear thus suitable for the reliable identification of species involved in shark attacks on humans. Moreover, microsatellite genotyping reveals, in the studied cases, that two distinct individuals were responsible of the bites. Applying these genetic identification methods will resolve ambiguities on shark species involved in attacks and allow the collection of individual data to better understand and mitigate shark risk.
507	34214518	Preliminary characterization of pathogen-detection activities of serum antibodies from the banded houndshark Triakis scyllium.	Antibodies of cartilaginous fish are of scientific interest due to their phylogenetic position. In the present study, we developed antiserum against IgM of the banded houndshark, Triakis scyllium, and characterized binding activity of the IgM against fish pathogenic bacteria. Pentameric and monomeric IgM antibodies were separated by gel filtration chromatography using high performance liquid chromatography and SDS-PAGE. Antisera were developed by immunizing rabbits with unfractionated IgM antibodies separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Shark serum antibodies were found to have binding affinity for Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio anguillarum, Edwardsiella tarda, and Pseudomonas plecoglossicida antigens but not Lactococcus garvieae by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We speculate the binding activities of shark antibodies may confer protection against certain bacterial pathogens.

509	34210039	Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fisheries Threatening Shark Conservation in African Waters Revealed from High Levels of Shark Mislabelling in Ghana.	Mislabelling of fish and fish products has attracted much attention over the last decades, following public awareness of the practice of substituting high-value with low-value fish in markets, restaurants, and processed seafood. In some cases, mislabelling includes illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, contributing to overexploit substitute species that are undetectable when sold under wrong names. This is the first study of DNA barcoding to assess the level of mislabelling in fish marketed in Ghana, focusing on endangered shark species. Genetic identification was obtained from 650 base pair sequences within the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. All except one of 17 shark fillets analysed were wrongly labelled as compared with none of 28 samples of small commercial pelagic fish and 14 commercial shark samples purchased in Europe. Several substitute shark species in Ghana are endangered (
510	34205931	Flowability, Tear Strength, and Hydrophilicity of Current Elastomers for Dental Impressions.	This study investigates 2 polyethers (PE), 2 polyvinylsiloxanethers (VXSE), and 10 polyvinylsiloxanes (PVS), seven of which had a corresponding light-body consistency and seven of which had a corresponding heavy-body consistency. Each light-body elastomer underwent a flowability test using the shark fin method 20, 50, and 80 s after mixing. The tear strength test DIN 53504 was used after setting the time (T0). Next, 24 h later (T1), hydrophilicity testing was used with static contact angles in water drops during polymerization (20, 50, and 80 s, as well as after 10 min). The heavy-body elastomers underwent shark fin testing with a corresponding light-body material at 50 and 80 s after mixing. The results of light-body testing were combined in a score to describe their performance. The highest differences were detected within flowability in shark fin heights between PE and a PVS (means of 15.89 and 6.85 mm) within the maximum tear strengths at T0 between a PVS and PE (3.72 and 0.75 MPa), as well as within hydrophilicity during setting between VXSE and a PVS (15.09° and 75.5°). The results indicate that VSXE and novel PVS materials can significantly compensate shortcomings in PE towards tear strength and hydrophilicity, but not flowability.
511	34199407	Novel Approach to Tooth Chemistry. Quantification of the Dental-Enamel Junction.	The dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) is known for its special role in teeth. Several techniques were applied for the investigation of the DEJ in human sound molar teeth. The electron (EPMA) and proton (PIXE) microprobes gave consistent indications about the variability of elemental concentrations on this boundary. The locally increased and oscillating concentrations of Mg and Na were observed in the junction, in the layer adhering to the enamel and covering roughly half of the DEJ width. The chemical results were compared with the optical profiles of the junction. Our chemical and optical results were next compared with the micromechanical results (hardness, elastic modulus, friction coefficient) available in the world literature. A strong correlation of both result sets was proven, which testifies to the self-affinity of the junction structures for different locations and even for different kinds of teeth and techniques applied for studies. Energetic changes in tooth strictly connected with crystallographic transformations were calculated, and the minimum energetic status was discovered for DEJ zone. Modeling of both walls of the DEJ from optical data was demonstrated. Comparing the DEJ in human teeth with the same structure found in dinosaur, shark, and alligator teeth evidences the universality of dentin enamel junction in animal world. The paper makes a contribution to better understanding the joining of the different hard tissues.
512	34191822	Deep-sea biodiversity at the extremes of the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges with implications for conservation.	The Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are underwater mountain chains that stretch across 2,900 km in the southeastern Pacific and are recognized for their high biodiversity value and unique ecological characteristics. Explorations of deep-water ecosystems have been limited in this region, and elsewhere globally. To characterize community composition of mesophotic and deep-sea demersal fauna at seamounts in the region, we conducted expeditions to Rapa Nui (RN) and Salas y Gómez (SyG) islands in 2011 and Desventuradas Islands in 2013. Remote autonomous baited-cameras were used to conduct stationary video surveys between 150-1,850 m at RN/SyG (N = 20) and 75-2,363 m at Desventuradas (N = 27). Individual organisms were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and relative abundance was quantified with the maximum number of individuals per frame. Deployments were attributed with associated environmental variables (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, chlorophyll-a, seamount age, and bathymetric position index [BPI]). We identified 55 unique invertebrate taxa and 66 unique fish taxa. Faunal community structure was highly dissimilar between and within subregions both for invertebrate (p < 0.001) and fish taxa (p = 0.022). For fishes, dogfish sharks (Squalidae) accounted for the greatest dissimilarity between subregions (18.27%), with mean abundances of 2.26 ± 2.49 at Desventuradas, an order of magnitude greater than at RN/SyG (0.21 ± 0.54). Depth, seamount age, broad-scale BPI, and nitrate explained most of the variation in both invertebrate (R2 = 0.475) and fish (R2 = 0.419) assemblages. Slightly more than half the deployments at Desventuradas (N = 14) recorded vulnerable marine ecosystem taxa such as corals and sponges. Our study supports mounting evidence that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges are areas of high biodiversity and high conservation value. While Chile and Peru have recently established or proposed marine protected areas in this region, the majority of these ridges lie outside of national jurisdictions and are under threat from overfishing, plastic pollution, climate change, and potential deep-sea mining. Given its intrinsic value, this region should be comprehensively protected using the best available conservation measures to ensure that the Salas y Gómez and Nazca ridges remain a globally unique biodiversity hotspot.
513	34183409	Museum genomics reveals the rapid decline and extinction of Australian rodents since European settlement.	Australia has the highest historically recorded rate of mammalian extinction in the world, with 34 terrestrial species declared extinct since European colonization in 1788. Among Australian mammals, rodents have been the most severely affected by these recent extinctions; however, given a sparse historical record, the scale and timing of their decline remain unresolved. Using museum specimens up to 184 y old, we generate genomic-scale data from across the entire assemblage of Australian hydromyine rodents (i.e., eight extinct species and their 42 living relatives). We reconstruct a phylogenomic tree for these species spanning ∼5.2 million years, revealing a cumulative total of 10 million years (>10%) of unique evolutionary history lost to extinction within the past ∼150 y. We find no evidence for reduced genetic diversity in extinct species just prior to or during decline, indicating that their extinction was extremely rapid. This suggests that populations of extinct Australian rodents were large prior to European colonization, and that genetic diversity does not necessarily protect species from catastrophic extinction. In addition, comparative analyses suggest that body size and biome interact to predict extinction and decline, with larger species more likely to go extinct. Finally, we taxonomically resurrect a species from extinction, Gould's mouse (
514	34180124	Structure and function of Shark Bay microbial communities following tropical cyclone Olwyn: A metatranscriptomic and organic geochemical perspective.	"Shark Bay, Western Australia, is episodically impacted by tropical cyclones. During 2015, the region was hit by a category 3 cyclone, ""severe tropical cyclone Olywn,"" leading to the formation of a black sludge in an intertidal zone harboring microbial mats and microbialites. Upon returning to the impacted site 12 months later, the black sludge deposit was still recognizable between the microbialite columns and mucilaginous cobbles near the shoreline in the impacted area. Metatranscriptomic and organic geochemical analyses were carried out on the cyclone-derived materials and impacted microbial mat communities to unravel the structure, function, and potential preservation of these deposits following a tropical cyclone. It was found that samples derived from the black sludge contained low relative abundances of cyanobacteria but had higher proportions of heterotrophic and anaerobic microorganisms (e.g., methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria). Increased metabolic activity by these microorganisms (e.g., sulfate reduction and organic matter degradation) is thought to drive calcium carbonate precipitation and helps in mat preservation. Comparison of the aliphatic biomarker by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses showed that C"

An unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to survey shallow coastal habitat in which lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris), bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and Pacific nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma unami) were recorded. Sharks were more common in the afternoon, potentially using warmer shallow areas to behaviourally thermoregulate. This study highlights UAV surveying to be a viable tool for species identification, a limitation of previous terrestrial surveys conducted in the area.
516	34171581	Metal concentrations and metallothionein metal detoxification in blue sharks, Prionace glauca L. from the Western North Atlantic Ocean.	"BACKGROUND: Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to environmental metal contamination, accumulating these contaminants at high rates and excreting them slowly. The blue shark Prionace glauca L. is one of the most heavily fished elasmobranchs, although information regarding metal contamination and detoxification in this species is notably lacking.
METHODS: Blue sharks were sampled in the western North Atlantic Ocean, in offshore waters adjacent to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Total and metallothionein-bound liver and muscle metal concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), metallothionein detoxification and oxidative stress endpoints were determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry.
RESULTS: Metallothionein detoxification occurred for As, Cd, Cs, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, Ti and Zn in liver, and for As, Cd, Cs, Pb, Se, and Zn in muscle, while reduced glutathione defenses seem to be related to Co and Zn exposure.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report for several metals (Ag, Co, non-radioactive Cs, Sb, Ti and V) for this species, which will aid in establishing baseline elemental data for biomonitoring efforts, health metrics, and conservation measures."
517	34166710	A computational framework for studying energetics and resource management in sea turtle migration and autonomous systems.	Sea turtles complete migrations across vast distances, covering entire ocean basins. To track these migrations, satellite tracking tags are attached to their shells. The impact of these tags must be considered to ensure that turtles' natural behavior is not artificially and adversely impacted through tag-related drag, and that the data collected by a small sample of sea turtles accurately represents the larger population. Additionally, it can be difficult to study animal energetics in the field over large migration distances. In this work, we modify a computational behavior model to study how satellite tracking tags affect turtle migration behavior. Our agent based model contains synthetic magnetic field environments that are used for navigation cues, an ocean current, resource distributions that represent locations of food, and an agent that attempts to migrate to several different goals. The agent loses energy as it progresses, and searches for the resource distributions to replenish itself. Our novel simulation framework demonstrates the relationship between an agent's available energy capacity, its energy consumption based on mechanical power expended, and its ability to navigate to all migratory goal points. This study can be utilized to (1) probe the impacts of an animal's energy capacity and foraging behavior on its resulting navigation and ecology, (2) guide future satellite tag designs, and (3) develop usage recommendations for a suitable tracking tag based on the type of experiment being conducted. Our model can be expanded beyond sea turtles to study other marine species (e.g., sharks, whales). Additionally, this model could be expanded to other domains within the marine environment. For example, it could be modified to examine design trade-offs in remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), which share many of the same operational constraints as sea turtles and other migratory species.
518	34159587	General descriptions of the dermis structure of a juvenile whale shark Rhincodon typus from the Gulf of California.	The aim of this study is to provide preliminary observations on the microanatomy of Rhincodon typus skin using histology and electron microscopy analyses. Skin biopsies were obtained from a deceased juvenile male shark (548 cm total length) stranded in La Paz, Mexico, during February 2018. The results of this study evidenced the basic structure of the dermal denticles in the epidermis of the trunk of the shark, as well as the composition of the connective tissue in the hypodermis. Histological images of the hypodermis showed a high concentration of collagen fibres, formed by a large number of fine and wavy fibres of compact shape and little intercellular substance.
519	34157537	Mercury and selenium concentrations in different tissues of brown smooth-hound shark (Mustelus henlei) from the western coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico.	A study on mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) concentrations in the liver and muscle of brown smooth-hound shark Mustelus henlei and its principal prey items, was conducted in the western coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Average Hg concentrations were found to be high in the muscle than in the liver; however, Hg concentrations were below the maximum permissible limits, and hence, the consumption of this species does not constitute a risk to human health. The mean Se concentrations were higher in the liver than in the muscle. The results of Hg: Se molar ratio revealed that Se counteracts the toxicity of Hg in hepatic tissues, whereas the contrary occurs in the muscle. Significant differences in Hg and Se accumulation were observed between females and males. Biomagnification factor values >1 demonstrate a biomagnification process from its principal prey species (i.e., red crab, Pleuroncodes planipes and Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus).
520	34153096	REDESCRIPTION OF CATHARIOTREMA SELACHII (MACCALLUM, 1916) JOHNSTON AND TIEGS, 1922 (MONOGENOIDEA: MONOCOTYLIDAE), EMENDATION OF MONOTYPIC CATHARIOTREMA JOHNSTON AND TIEGS, 1922, AND PROPOSAL OF CATHARIOTREMATINAE N. SUBFAM. BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL AND NUCLEOTIDE EVIDENCE.	We herein redescribe the enigmatic Cathariotrema selachii (MacCallum, 1916) Johnston and Tiegs, 1922 based on the holotype, paratypes, and newly collected specimens infecting the olfactory organ of 5 shark species from the Gulf of Mexico (all new host records): scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini (Griffith and Smith, 1834) (Carcharhiniformes: Sphyrnidae); great hammerhead shark, Sphyrna mokarran (Rüppell, 1837); blacktip shark, Carcharhinus limbatus (Müller and Henle, 1839) (Carcharhiniformes: Carcharhinidae); spinner shark, Carcharhinus brevipinna (Müller and Henle, 1839); and Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson, 1836) (Carcharhinidae). These specimens were morphologically indistinguishable from each other and from MacCallum's holotype and paratypes. Those sequenced had identical first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) and large subunit ribosomal DNA (28S) nucleotide sequences. As such, C. selachii infects sharks of 2 orders (Carcharhiniformes, Lamniformes) and 3 families (Carcharhinidae, Sphyrnidae, Lamnidae) in the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean (type locality) and Gulf of Mexico (new records herein). This report is the first of new specimens of C. selachii in the Atlantic Ocean Basin in 95 yr and corrects long-standing error cascades and ambiguities concerning the morphology and systematic placement of C. selachii. Considering morphology and nucleotide-based phylogenetic evidence (28S, Bayesian analysis), we herein emend monotypic CathariotremaJohnston and Tiegs, 1922 and propose Cathariotrematinae Bullard n. subfam. for it and 4 other genera (all formerly assigned to Merizocotylinae Johnston and Tiegs, 1922). These genera comprise species infecting only the nose of sharks (monotypic Cathariotrema, SqualotremaKearn and Green, 1983 and SeptitremaKheddam, Chisholm, and Tazerouti, 2020 plus 3 species of TriloculotremaKearn, 1993) and nose of a chimaera (monotypic HolocephalocotyleDerouiche, Neifar, Gey, Justine, and Tazerouti, 2019). Cathariotrematinae differs from Merizocotylinae by having a 3-part attachment organ and by lacking open loculi that symmetrically encircle a cluster of >2 loculi in the center of the haptor. Monophyletic Cathariotrematinae (with sequences representing species of Cathariotrema, Triloculotrema, and Holocephalocotyle only) was sister to monophyletic Merizocotylinae, which together were sister to monophyletic Calicotylinae Monticelli, 1903. These subfamilies comprise a monophyletic group of monocotylids that have a double vagina and infect extrabranchial, enclosed niches (urogenital system, body cavity, olfactory chamber/nose) on their shark, ray, and chimaera hosts (all other monocotylids have a single vagina and infect the gill or body surfaces of rays only). Monocotylinae Taschenberg, 1879 and Decacotylinae Chisholm, Wheeler, and Beverley-Burton, 1995 were recovered as monophyletic. Heterocotylinae Chisholm, Wheeler, and Beverley-Burton, 1995 remained paraphyletic. We accept ParacalicotyleSzidat, 1970.
521	34150212	Ocean warming impairs the predator avoidance behaviour of elasmobranch embryos.	Embryogenesis is a vulnerable stage in elasmobranch development due in part to high predation mortality. Embryonic elasmobranchs respond to potential predators by displaying a freezing behaviour, characterized by the cessation of pharyngeal respiration followed immediately by coiling of the tail around the body. We hypothesized that the duration of this freeze response is limited by the embryo's requirement for oxygen. Here, 
522	34148252	Retrospective study of phaeohyphomycosis in aquarium-housed fish, with first descriptions of Exophiala lecanii-corni and Neodevriesia cladophorae in fish.	A broadening fish host range is affected by novel and known pigmented fungal pathogens. A review of 2,250 piscine submissions received by the Aquatic Pathology Service, University of Georgia, revealed 47 phaeohyphomycosis cases (2.1%), representing 34 bony and cartilaginous fish species. The majority involved bony fish (45/47, 95.7%) and were predominantly marine (41/47, 87.2%), with only a few freshwater species (4/47, 8.5%). Cartilaginous fish cases included two zebra sharks (Stegostoma fasciatum) (2/47, 4.3%). Northern seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) had the highest incidence overall (7/47, 14.9%). Culture and sequencing of the internal-transcribed spacer region of the rDNA (ITS), large ribosomal subunit gene D1/D2 domains (LSU) and the DNA polymerase II gene (RPB2) were performed for fungal identification when fresh tissue was obtainable. Exophiala, Ochroconis and Neodevriesia spp. were identified, with Exophiala as the most common fungal genus (8/11, 72.7%). Exophiala lecanii-corni and Neodevriesia cladophorae were described for the first time from fish. Microscopically, lesions were characterized by necrosis, granulomatous inflammation and angioinvasion most frequently affecting the skin/fin, skeletal muscle and kidneys. In this study of diverse aquarium-housed fish species, phaeohyphomycosis cases occurred sporadically and in rare outbreaks with variable pathologic presentations, tissue distributions and severities.
523	34146855	Contamination knows no borders: Toxic organic compounds pollute plastics in the biodiversity hotspot of Revillagigedo Archipelago National Park, Mexico.	Plastic pollution is ubiquitous and not even remote protected islands are safe from it. Floating debris can adsorb toxic compounds that concentrate on their surface, being available to the animals that ingest them. For this reason, a baseline study of plastic pollution was conducted in the remote Revillagigedo Archipelago, in the Mexican Pacific Ocean. In 47 manta net samples an average of 4.8 plastics/1000m
524	34146594	Shark liver oil supplementation enriches endogenous plasmalogens and reduces markers of dyslipidemia and inflammation.	Plasmalogens are membrane glycerophospholipids with diverse biological functions. Reduced plasmalogen levels have been observed in metabolic diseases; hence, increasing their levels might be beneficial in ameliorating these conditions. Shark liver oil (SLO) is a rich source of alkylglycerols that can be metabolized into plasmalogens. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of SLO supplementation on endogenous plasmalogen levels in individuals with features of metabolic disease. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study, the participants (10 overweight or obese males) received 4-g Alkyrol® (purified SLO) or placebo (methylcellulose) per day for 3 weeks followed by a 3-week washout phase and were then crossed over to 3 weeks of the alternate placebo/Alkyrol® treatment. SLO supplementation led to significant changes in plasma and circulatory white blood cell lipidomes, notably increased levels of plasmalogens and other ether lipids. In addition, SLO supplementation significantly decreased the plasma levels of total free cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein. These findings suggest that SLO supplementation can enrich plasma and cellular plasmalogens and this enrichment may provide protection against obesity-related dyslipidemia and inflammation.
525	34146448	Individual haplotyping of whale sharks from seawater environmental DNA.	"Population genetic data can provide valuable information on the demography of a species. For rare and elusive marine megafauna, samples for generating the data are traditionally obtained from tissue biopsies, which can be logistically difficult and expensive to collect and require invasive sampling techniques. Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers an alternative, minimally invasive approach to provide important genetic information. Although eDNA approaches have been studied extensively for species detection and biodiversity monitoring in metabarcoding studies, the potential for the technique to address population-level questions remains largely unexplored. Here, we applied ""eDNA haplotyping"" to obtain estimates of the intraspecific genetic diversity of a whale shark (Rhincodon typus) aggregation at Ningaloo reef, Australia. Over 2 weeks, we collected seawater samples directly behind individual sharks prior to taking a tissue biopsy sample from the same animal. Our data showed a 100% match between mtDNA sequences recovered in the eDNA and tissue sample for all 28 individuals sampled. In the seawater samples, >97% of all reads were assigned to six dominant haplotypes, and a clear dominant signal (~99% of sample reads) was recovered in each sample. Our study demonstrates accurate individual-level haplotyping from seawater eDNA. When DNA from one individual clearly dominates each eDNA sample, it provides many of the same opportunities for population genetic analyses as a tissue sample, potentially removing the need for tissue sampling. Our results show that eDNA approaches for population-level analyses have the potential to supply critical demographic data for the conservation and management of marine megafauna."
526	34145907	Effects of climate-change-driven gradual and acute temperature changes on shark and ray species.	Climate change is altering distributions and abundances of marine species through both gradual and acute changes in temperature and productivity. Due to their high mobility and metabolic rates, elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) are likely to redistribute across latitudes and depths as they thermoregulate, but little is known about their responses to these climatic changes, which could vary widely across this diverse group of species. Here, we assessed how species with differing mobility and ecology responded to gradual changes in daily sea surface temperature (SST) and acute temperature anomalies, caused by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), at Cocos Island, Costa Rica, the site of multiple marine heatwaves. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyse 34,342 records of relative abundance or frequency of occurrence for seven shark and ray species collected in 27 years (1993-2019) by a dive company. We compared effect sizes for SST and the Oceanic Niño Index across the different species, which vary widely in body size and mobility. Large, mobile species responded strongly but inconsistently to temperature. For scalloped hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini, a 1℃ rise in SST reduced counts by over 14%, and dropped the occurrence of their large schools by almost one-fifth (19.4%). Mobula ray occurrence also declined substantially with a few degrees rise in SST, whereas tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier occurrence sharply increased. These species also had divergent responses to the ENSO: S. lewini and G. cuvier were sighted with greater frequency during La Niña events, and their abundance dropped considerably during El Niño events-over a twofold decline between a strong La Niña and strong El Niño for S. lewini. In contrast, Mobula rays showed little response to ENSO. The smaller and sedentary Triaenodon obesus exhibited the weakest response of all species to both SST and the ENSO, reflecting its lower metabolic rates and mobility. Climate change will continue to impact elasmobranchs, even for smaller and more localized species, with the potential to impact the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs). Our results compel further work on the diversity of elasmobranch responses to environmental change.
527	34145534	Identifying shark species responsible for fisheries depredation off Southeast Queensland, Australia.	Anecdotal reports from fishers in Southeast Queensland, Australia suggest that shark depredation is a significant issue, however little is known about which species are responsible for depredating catches. This research aimed to identify depredating species in Southeast Queensland line based fisheries, by undertaking a genetic analysis of depredated samples collected by commercial, charter and recreational fishers. The genetic analysis successfully identified ten depredating sharks, all from the genus Carcharhinus (19.2% success). The species identified using mitochondrial DNA included five C. leucas (bull sharks), two C. plumbeus (sandbar sharks), one C. amboinensis (pigeye shark), one C. brevipinna (spinner shark) and one unconfirmed C. plumbeus/C. altimus (bignose shark). While many species of Carcharhinus have been found to depredate catches in Australia, C. leucas has not been highlighted until this research as a potential problematic species. The optimised protocol allowed for the confident identification of shark species responsible for depredation in fisheries using frozen fish samples donated by fishers.
528	34145200	Printing a static progressive orthosis for hand rehabilitation.	"BACKGROUND: Static progressive orthosis is used for the treatment of severe joint contracture after trauma and/or surgery. However, a custom-fabricated static progressive splint would be expensive and labor intensive. Especially, owing to very limited payment under the current Taiwanese National Health Insurance, the incentives to fabricate a patient-specific splint are insufficient for a therapist. To ease splint construction, we introduced three-dimensional (3D)-printed ""shark fin""-shaped device works as a static progressive orthosis for the hand rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to describe and demonstrate the newly designed device.
METHODS: This study included a 46-year male suffered from a left distal radius fracture and underwent open reduction internal fixation and a 23-year male with the right thumb flexor pollicis longus rupture, requiring tendon repair. Both subjects used this ""shark fin""-shaped device to stretch for increasing range of motion (ROM) of wrist extension and the thumb.
RESULTS: The patient receiving ulnar shortening surgery used this device to stretch for increasing ROM of wrist extension. The active ROM of wrist extension improved from 30° to 50°. The other patient with the right thumb flexor pollicis longus rupture suffered from thumb contracture; the ROMs of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and interphalangeal (IP) joint were 40°-55° and 20°-25°, respectively. After tenolysis surgery, his ROMs of the MCP and IP joints were improved to 10°-35° and 40°-65°, respectively. Following physical therapy by applying the device, his ROMs of the MCP and IP joints were further increased to 0°-40° and 25°-70°, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating the ""shark fin""-shaped orthosis into hand rehabilitation increased the ROM of wrist extension for a patient with distal radius fracture and improved the ROM of the MCP and IP joints in another patient after tenolysis surgery."

Cartilaginous fish are the most primitive extant species with MHC molecules. Using the nurse shark, the current study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to present a peptide-loaded MHC class I (pMHC-I) structure for this class of animals. The overall structure was found to be similar between cartilaginous fish and bony animals, showing remarkable conservation of interactions between the three pMHC-I components H chain, β

532	34130224	Volume of the whale shark and their mechanism of vertical feeding.	The present study provides a noninvasive method to estimate the body volume of sharks (Elasmobranchii, Selachii) using a computational geometric model. This method allows the volume of sharks to be estimated from lateral and ventral photographs assuming an elliptical body cross-sectional geometry. A comparison of the estimated and actual body volumes of several shark species showed that the estimation error was < 0.5%. The accuracy of the model decreased if photographs that were inclined to the orthogonal plane were used, although this error was on average < 2.3% if the inclination angle was 10° or less. Applying this model to captive whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) that were 8.0 and 8.8 m in total length revealed that their body volumes were 3.5 and 4.5 m
533	34126790	Shark-Related Injuries in the United States: A National Trauma Data Bank Analysis.	"BACKGROUND: Shark-related injuries (SRIs) are a dreaded, but rare, source of injury that have not been well described. The present study aims to examine the incidence, injuries, and outcomes of SRIs presenting to US trauma centers.
STUDY DESIGN: The National Trauma Data Bank was queried from 2015 to 2018 to identify SRIs using ICD-10 e-codes W56.41XA, W56.42XA, and W56.49XA. Descriptive analyses were conducted on patient demographics, injuries, hospital course, procedures, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were identified with a mechanism of injury that was shark-related. The median age was 29 years (range: 3-67) and median injury severity score was 5 (IQR: 3-10). The majority of patients (96%) were admitted to the hospital (median length of stay (LOS): 4.0 days, IQR: 3.0-8.0), 55% went directly to the operating room, and 53% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission (median ICU LOS: 4.5 days, IQR: 1.3-7.0). Extremity injuries were common: 47% suffered lower extremity injuries, 40% had upper extremity injuries, and 13% had both. The majority of patients underwent surgical procedures: 83% had soft tissue injuries requiring debridement, flap coverage, or skin grafting; 28% suffered neurovascular injuries (17% requiring nerve repair and 2% requiring arterial bypass); and 59% required orthopedic intervention. Six patients (11%) required amputation(s). All patients survived to discharge.
CONCLUSION: Although an exceedingly rare source of trauma, SRIs are frequently associated with devastating injuries. Given the severity of injuries and associated procedures required, these patients warrant referral to a trauma center capable of providing comprehensive care."
535	34125301	First description of Chloromyxum squali Gleeson and Adlard, 2012 (Myxozoa) in the Mediterranean Sea in a new host Squalus blainville (Chondrichthyes: Squalidae): morphological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic data.	Chloromyxum squali Gleeson and Adlard, 2012 originally described from Squalus acanthias Linnaeus, 1758 is reported for the first time from the gallbladder of Squalus blainville (Risso, 1827) caught from the eastern coast of Tunisia. In the present study, this chloromyxid was described based on morphological and ultrastructural features combined with molecular analysis of 18S rDNA. Young plasmodia were found attached to the gallbladder, while mature plasmodia and myxospores were observed floating free in the bile. Mature plasmodia were polysporic, subspherical in shape, measured 97.8 ± 0.5 µm long and 63.4 ± 0.4 µm wide. Mature myxospores were ovoid with a pointed anterior end, measuring 10.2 ± 0.5 µm long and 8.3 ± 0.5 µm wide. Two asymmetrical shell valves adhered together along an S-shaped suture line. Each valve has 5-7 elevated surface ridges parallel to suture line. A bundle of long caudal filaments extended from the basal end of shell valves. Four pyriform polar capsules equal in size, measuring 3.1 ± 0.4 µm long and 2.5 ± 0.3 µm wide, were situated at the same level in the anterior pole of the myxospore, each with a polar filament coiled in 7-8 turns. Pairwise comparisons among the SSU rDNA sequences revealed significant similarity between Chloromyxum squali infecting S. acanthias with the sequence obtained in this study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that C. squali clustered in the clade of Chloromyxum species infecting the gallbladder of marine Chondrichthyes. Chloromyxum squali showed a seasonal variation of prevalence with significantly higher prevalence noted in summer and in autumn and absence of infection in winter.
536	34124561	A 'shark'-masked electrocardiogram: case report of a Tako-Tsubo syndrome.	"BACKGROUND: Triangular ST-segment elevation or 'shark-fin' sign has been described as a specific indicator of acute coronary occlusion and large myocardial ischaemia, translating into poorer prognosis. However, this electrocardiographic presentation has been reported in rare cases of Tako-Tsubo syndrome and associated with more severe physical stressors and neurological involvement.
CASE SUMMARY: We present a rare case of a 51-year-old woman presenting with incoming epileptic attacks and concomitant pyometra. Despite controlling epilepsy with phenytoin and the surgical treatment of the infection, she developed sepsis requiring vasopressors, and thereafter sustained ventricular tachycardia and diffuse ST-segment elevation with the 'shark-fin' sign. TTC was confirmed by the documentation of normal coronary arteries and the complete recovery of wall motion abnormalities at discharge.
DISCUSSION: Heterogeneous presentation and triggering conditions often challenge the diagnosis of Tako-Tsubo syndrome. The acknowledgement of different electrocardiographic and clinical manifestations can ease the diagnosis and the successful management of these patients, whose prognosis can be extremely severe in the acute phase, if unidentified."
537	34121177	Sharks surf the slope: Current updrafts reduce energy expenditure for aggregating marine predators.	An animal's energy landscape considers the power requirements associated with residing in or moving through habitats. Within marine environments, these landscapes can be dynamic as water currents will influence animal power requirements and can change rapidly over diel and tidal cycles. In channels and along slopes with strong currents, updraft zones may reduce energy expenditure of negatively buoyant fishes that are also obligate swimmers. Despite marine predators often residing within high-current area, no study has investigated the potential role of the energetic landscape in driving such habitat selectivity. Over 500 grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos reside in the southern channel of Fakarava Atoll, French Polynesia. We used diver observations, acoustic telemetry and biologging to show that sharks use regions of predicted updrafts and switch their core area of space use based on tidal state (incoming versus outgoing). During incoming tides, sharks form tight groups and display shuttling behaviour (moving to the front of the group and letting the current move them to the back) to maintain themselves in these potential updraft zones. During outgoing tides, group dispersion increases, swimming depths decrease and shuttling behaviours cease. These changes are likely due to shifts in the nature and location of the updraft zones, as well as turbulence during outgoing tides. Using a biomechanical model, we estimate that routine metabolic rates for sharks may be reduced by 10%-15% when in updraft zones. Grey reef sharks save energy using predicted updraft zones in channels and 'surfing the slope'. Analogous to birds using wind-driven updraft zones, negatively buoyant marine animals may use current-induced updraft zones to reduce energy expenditure. Updrafts should be incorporated into dynamic energy landscapes and may partially explain the distribution, behaviour and potentially abundance of marine predators.

Inhibiting the activity of the intestinal enzyme α-amylase that catalyzes the degradation of starch into glucose can control blood glucose and provide an essential way for the treatment of Type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we compared the structural information of chondroitin sulfate (CS) from different origins and the effects on activity of α-amylase and blood glucose have been investigated. The inhibitory effects of shark and porcine CSs against α-amylase activity is obvious with IC
539	34119424	Production of monoclonal shark-derived immunoglobulin new antigen receptor antibodies using Chinese hamster ovary cell expression system.	Cartilaginous fishes such as sharks have adaptive immune systems based on immunoglobulins similar to those in mammals. During their evolution, cartilaginous fishes individually have acquired their adaptive immune system called immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNARs). IgNARs maintain their functions in the harsh environment of shark serum, which contains a high concentration of urea to prevent water loss in seawater. Therefore, IgNARs have high structural stability, and are expected to be used as next-generation antibodies in applications different from those of conventional IgG antibodies. However, no recombinant expression system for IgNAR, which has a molecular weight of approximately 147 kDa as a dimer and multiple N-glycosylation sites, has yet been constructed. This has stalled research into IgNAR development. Here, we constructed a recombinant expression system for IgNAR using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, widely used as hosts for IgG antibody production. Using this system, IgNAR was successfully expressed and purified as a human IgG Fc fusion protein and showed antigen-binding ability. After Protein A affinity purification, followed by specific cleavage and removal of the human Fc-region, the final yield of IgNAR was 1.07 mg/L-medium. Moreover, this CHO cell expression system modified IgNAR with various N-glycans, including high-mannose and complex types. This expression system will allow us to analyze the structure, physicochemical properties, and biological functions of IgNAR. This fundamental information will advance the development of IgNARs for industrial and biotechnological applications.
540	34108282	"Application of Single-Domain Antibodies (""Nanobodies"") to Laboratory Diagnosis."	"Antibodies have proven to be central in the development of diagnostic methods over decades, moving from polyclonal antibodies to the milestone development of monoclonal antibodies. Although monoclonal antibodies play a valuable role in diagnosis, their production is technically demanding and can be expensive. The large size of monoclonal antibodies (150 kDa) makes their re-engineering using recombinant methods a challenge. Single-domain antibodies, such as ""nanobodies,"" are a relatively new class of diagnostic probes that originated serendipitously during the assay of camel serum. The immune system of the camelid family (camels, llamas, and alpacas) has evolved uniquely to produce heavy-chain antibodies that contain a single monomeric variable antibody domain in a smaller functional unit of 12-15 kDa. Interestingly, the same biological phenomenon is observed in sharks. Since a single-domain antibody molecule is smaller than a conventional mammalian antibody, recombinant engineering and protein expression "

543	34102168	Shark and ray genomics for disentangling their morphological diversity and vertebrate evolution.	Developmental studies of sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) have provided much insight into the process of morphological evolution of vertebrates. Although those studies are supposedly fueled by large-scale molecular sequencing information, whole-genome sequences of sharks and rays were made available only recently. One compelling difficulty of elasmobranch developmental biology is the low accessibility to embryonic study materials and their slow development. Another limiting factor is the relatively large size of their genomes. Moreover, their large body sizes restrict sustainable captive breeding, while their high body fluid osmolarity prevents reproducible cell culturing for in vitro experimentation, which has also limited our knowledge of their chromosomal organization for validation of genome sequencing products. This article focuses on egg-laying elasmobranch species used in developmental biology and provides an overview of the characteristics of the shark and ray genomes revealed to date. Developmental studies performed on a gene-by-gene basis are also reviewed from a whole-genome perspective. Among the popular regulatory genes studied in developmental biology, I scrutinize shark homologs of Wnt genes that highlight vanishing repertoires in many other vertebrate lineages, as well as Hox genes that underwent an unexpected modification unique to the elasmobranch lineage. These topics are discussed together with insights into the reconstruction of developmental programs in the common ancestor of vertebrates and its subsequent evolutionary trajectories that mark the features that are unique to, and those characterizing the diversity among, cartilaginous fishes.
544	34098787	Major organ loss from post-mortem animal predation: Issues arising from emptied body cavities.	The feeding of animals on bodies after death - so-called post-mortem animal predation - may complicate autopsy interpretations when there has been removal of significant amounts of skin and tissues. An extreme situation which sometimes arises is the complete evisceration and/or consumption of all major cavity organs. Search of autopsy files at Forensic Science South Australia was undertaken for examples of this phenomenon. Although such a finding at autopsy may suggest the actions of larger animals such as dogs or sharks, it may also occur when groups of smaller animals, such as cats, act in concert. Complete loss of organs may also occur if significant insect activity accompanies decomposition. Empty body cavities may therefore result from of a wide variety of animal activities involving a range of species in quite different environments. A significant problem once organs have been removed or consumed is in identifying or excluding natural diseases or injuries that may have played a role in the lethal episode.
545	34087035	Metazoan activity facilitates passive sediment trapping in modern supratidal microbialites: Revealed using µ-CT-scanning and microscopy.	Microbialites are formed through two processes, the trapping and binding of sediment grains and mineral precipitation. Sediment trapping and binding result in coarse sandy textures, whereas fine micritic textures are produced by mineral precipitation. Although well-studied modern microbialites (e.g. Bahamas and Shark Bay) are formed through the former process, purely trapped-and-bound examples are rare throughout the geologic record and limited to shallow-marine environments. Through the use of conventional microscopy and 3D micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) scanning, this study found that South African coastal microbialites have a primarily mineral precipitated texture, although detrital material is included sporadically. Furthermore, these modern microbialites exhibit both micritic and fibrous layering with high porosity. The novel use of 3D microtomography rotational scans has revealed that microbialites are extensively burrowed by metazoan activity and was also able to distinguish the occurrence and distribution of heavy minerals and detrital shell material in the samples. Some of the detrital grains appeared to be accidental/random inclusions, while in other cases the metazoan burrows provided space for the accumulation of sediment once abandoned. In both cases, sediment was incorporated as a product of intermittent accumulation, rather than systematic trapping and binding. The microfabric texture of South African microbialites is therefore a function of both biological (e.g. microbially mediated precipitation) and environmental (e.g. sporadic sediment deposition and inorganic cementation) influence. Overall, the findings presented here highlight the importance of these systems regarding microbialite formation, ichnology and taphonomy.
546	34085705	Potential expansion in the spatial distribution of subtropical and temperate west Australian sharks.	Fishery-dependent and -independent data collected since 1975 were examined to explore the spatial distribution of 30 shark and ray species in the west coast of Australia. Bigeye sixgill (Hexanchus nakamurai), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) and spinner (Carcarhinus brevipinna) sharks, and scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) were observed >1000 and 300 km to the east of the edge of their reported distributions. Broadnose sevengill sharks (Notorhyncus cepedianus) and southern sawsharks (Pristiophorus nudipinnis) were observed >1000 km to the west of the edge of their reported distributions. Our study highlights the value of collecting and examining long time-series of data for understanding the spatial distribution of large marine predators.
547	34083578	Integrating multiple chemical tracers to elucidate the diet and habitat of Cookiecutter Sharks.	The Cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis) is an ectoparasitic, mesopelagic shark that is known for removing plugs of tissue from larger prey, including teleosts, chondrichthyans, cephalopods, and marine mammals. Although this species is widely distributed throughout the world's tropical and subtropical oceanic waters, like many deep-water species, it remains very poorly understood due to its mesopelagic distribution. We used a suite of biochemical tracers, including stable isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid analysis (FAA), and environmental DNA (eDNA), to investigate the trophic ecology of this species in the Central Pacific around Hawaii. We found that large epipelagic prey constituted a relatively minor part of the overall diet. Surprisingly, small micronektonic and forage species (meso- and epipelagic) are the most important prey group for Cookiecutter sharks across the studied size range (17-43 cm total length), with larger mesopelagic species or species that exhibit diel vertical migration also being important prey. These results were consistent across all the tracer techniques employed. Our results indicate that Cookiecutter sharks play a unique role in pelagic food webs, feeding on prey ranging from the largest apex predators to small, low trophic level species, in particular those that overlap with the depth distribution of the sharks throughout the diel cycle. We also found evidence of a potential shift in diet and/or habitat with size and season. Environmental DNA metabarcoding revealed new prey items for Cookiecutter sharks while also demonstrating that eDNA can be used to identify recent prey in stomachs frozen for extended periods. Integrating across chemical tracers is a powerful tool for investigating the ecology of elusive and difficult to study species, such as meso- and bathypelagic chondrichthyans, and can increase the amount of information gained from small sample sizes. Better resolving the foraging ecology of these mesopelagic predators is critical for effective conservation and management of these taxa and ecosystems, which are intrinsically vulnerable to overfishing and exploitation.
548	34083491	An early Miocene extinction in pelagic sharks.	Shark populations have been decimated in recent decades because of overfishing and other anthropogenic stressors; however, the long-term impacts of such changes in marine predator abundance and diversity are poorly constrained. We present evidence for a previously unknown major extinction event in sharks that occurred in the early Miocene, ~19 million years ago. During this interval, sharks virtually disappeared from open-ocean sediments, declining in abundance by >90% and morphological diversity by >70%, an event from which they never recovered. This abrupt extinction occurred independently from any known global climate event and ~2 million to 5 million years before diversifications in the highly migratory, large-bodied predators that dominate pelagic ecosystems today, indicating that the early Miocene was a period of rapid, transformative change for open-ocean ecosystems.
550	34080193	Age and growth of the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) around Reunion Island, South West Indian Ocean.	Sharks exhibit varied demographic strategies depending on both the species and the population location, which make them more or less vulnerable to fishing. Accurate evaluation of local age and growth parameters is therefore fundamental for the sustainable management of their stocks. Although demographic parameters have been assessed for bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) populations in several locations of the world, this information is missing so far around Reunion Island, in the south-west Indian Ocean. To fill this gap of knowledge, age and growth data were gathered from the vertebrae of 140 individuals of C. leucas (77 females and 63 males, mostly adults) fished around the island between 2012 and 2019. After verification of the annual deposition of growth band pairs on these structures using relative marginal increment analysis on 40 individuals, band pairs were counted along the vertebral centrum for each individual. Thanks to this approach, growth was shown to significantly differ between male and female C. leucas around Reunion Island, with respective von Bertalanffy growth model equations of L

552	34076895	Evidence of egg-laying grounds for critically endangered flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) off Orkney, UK.	Essential fish habitats (EFHs) are critical for fish life-history events, including spawning, breeding, feeding or growth. This study provides evidence of EFHs for the critically endangered flapper skate (Dipturus intermedius) in the waters around the Orkney Isles, Scotland, based on citizen-science observation data. The habitats of potential egg-laying sites were parametrised as >20 m depth, with boulders or exposed bedrock, in moderate current flow (0.3-2.8 knots) with low sedimentation. This information provides a significant contribution to the understanding of EFHs for flapper skate.
553	34073841	Incorporation of an Allogenic Cortical Bone Graft Following Arthrodesis of the First Metatarsophalangeal Joint in a Patient with Hallux Rigidus.	Hallux rigidus is degenerative arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint characterized by pain and stiffness in the joint with limitation of motion and functional impairment. Recently, bone grafts have been introduced in orthopedic procedures, namely osteosynthesis and arthrodesis. Allografts can induce bone formation, provide support for vascular and bone ingrowth and have a low risk of immunological rejection. A 52-year-old female patient with hallux rigidus underwent arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint using Shark Screw
554	34059768	A natural constant predicts survival to maximum age.	Information about the survival of species is important in many ecological applications. Yet, the estimation of a species' natural mortality rate M remains a major problem in the management and conservation of wild populations, often circumvented by applying empirical equations that relate mortality to other traits that are more easily observed. We show that mean adult M can be approximated from the general law of decay if the average maximum age reached by individuals in a cohort is known. This is possible because the proportion P of individuals surviving to the average maximum age in a cohort is surprisingly similar across a wide range of examined species at 1.5%. The likely reason for the narrow range of P is a universal increase in the rate of mortality near the end of life, providing strong evidence that the evolutionary theories of ageing are the norm in natural populations.
556	34058188	Female sperm storage in the bonnethead Sphyrna tiburo oviducal gland: Immunolocalization of steroid hormone receptors in sperm storage tubules.	Female sperm storage (FSS) has been demonstrated to occur in representatives from all major vertebrate groups and has been hypothesized to have several possible adaptive benefits that may maximize reproductive success of its practitioners. However, while the range of taxa that exhibit FSS and its possible evolutionary benefits have received significant attention in past years, the physiological mechanisms by which FSS occurs in vertebrates have only recently been explored. In this study, we examined the potential role of gonadal steroid hormones in regulating FSS in the bonnethead Sphyrna tiburo, a small hammerhead species in which females have been shown to be capable of storing male spermatozoa for up to 6 - 7 months following copulation. Like past studies on this species, we observed associations between plasma concentrations of the gonadal steroids 17β-estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone with FSS in female bonnetheads, suggesting roles for these hormones in regulating this process. Using immunohistochemistry, we also observed presence of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and progesterone receptor in epithelial cells of sperm storage tubules in the bonnethead oviducal gland, as well as occurrence of ERα in stored spermatozoa, specifically during the sperm storage period. These results suggest that E

Ecuador's Galapagos Islands and their unique biodiversity are a global conservation priority. We explored the presence, composition and environmental drivers of plastic contamination across the marine ecosystem at an island scale, investigated uptake in marine invertebrates and designed a systematic priority scoring analysis to identify the most vulnerable vertebrate species. Beach contamination varied by site (macroplastic 0-0.66 items·m
558	34030348	Metabolic and nutritional condition of juvenile tiger sharks exposed to regional differences in coastal urbanization.	How varying levels of human activity, such as proximity and size of the nearest market (i.e., market gravity), influence the nutritional ecology and physiological condition of highly migratory marine predators is poorly understood. In the present study, we used a non-lethal approach to compare the concentration of metabolic hormones (i.e. corticosteroids and thyroid hormones) and plasma fatty acids between juvenile female tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) sampled in two areas of the subtropical north Atlantic, which differed markedly in their levels of coastal urbanization, Florida and the Bahamas (high versus low, respectively). We hypothesized that juvenile female tiger sharks sampled in water surrounding high coastal urbanization (Florida), would exhibit evidence of lower prey quality and higher energetic demands as compared to individuals sampled in relatively less urbanized areas of Northern Bahamas. Results revealed that relative corticosteroid levels (a proxy for energy mobilization) were higher in juvenile female tiger sharks sampled in Florida; however, no differences were found in concentrations of thyroid hormones (proxies of energetic adjustments) between the two locations. We found higher percentages of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (indicative of high prey quality) in juvenile tiger sharks from Florida, whereas higher percentages of bacterial markers (often indicative of domestic sewage effluent) were detected in the individuals sampled in the Bahamas. Taken together, these findings do not suggest that the differences in nutritional quality and metabolic condition found between the two sampling locations can be fully attributed to foraging in areas exposed to differing levels of urbanization. We speculate that these patterns may be due to the highly migratory nature and generalist feeding strategy of this species, even at the juvenile life stage, as well as proximity of sampling locations from shore.
559	34029810	Equatorial Atlantic pelagic predators reveal low content of PBDEs in contrast to MeO-BDEs: An analysis of brominated diphenyl ethers in blue shark and yellowfin tuna.	Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their methoxylated analogues (MeO-BDEs) are widely distributed in the environment. The main concern about the presence of PBDEs and MeO-BDEs in fish is due to their potential endocrine disruption effects in the specimens, and their potential risk to the health of human consumers. Considering these concerns, the goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence of PBDEs and MeO-BDEs in muscle tissues of blue shark (BSH), Prionace glauca, and yellowfin tuna (YFT), Thunnus albacares, caught in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (EAO), North-eastern Brazilian waters, and to evaluate the potential risk of human exposure by consumption. Muscle tissues of YFT and BSH were extracted using a Soxhlet apparatus and an Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE), respectively. PBDEs and MeO-BDEs were analysed by GC-NCI-MS. Concentrations of PBDEs ranged from not detected (nd) to 10 ng g

One of the most landed sharks in Portuguese fisheries is the lesser-spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula), which is ever-present in Portuguese fish markets and consumed as cheap fish protein source. The focus of this study was to evaluate element contamination in consumed tissues of Atlantic S. canicula, with the intent of safeguarding possible public health issues. A total of 74 specimens were analysed for metals and metalloids in the deeper white muscle and skin. Arsenic, zinc, iron and aluminium were the elements with higher mean values. There was a tendency for higher levels in the skin, with differences between life-stage and gender. Many individuals surpassed stipulated guideline limits for mercury and arsenic, posing a risk for human consumption (according to the health risk assessment performed for the average Portuguese fish consumption) or even for use in feed production. Besides the public health concern, this study also evidences troubling signs on marine contamination status.
563	34019307	Gill surface area provides a clue for the respiratory basis of brain size in the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus).	Brain size varies dramatically, both within and across species, and this variation is often believed to be the result of trade-offs between the cognitive benefits of having a large brain for a given body size and the energetic cost of sustaining neural tissue. One potential consequence of having a large brain is that organisms must also meet the associated high energetic demands. Thus, a key question is whether metabolic rate correlates with brain size. However, using metabolic rate to measure energetic demand yields a relatively instantaneous and dynamic measure of energy turnover, which is incompatible with the longer evolutionary timescale of changes in brain size within and across species. Morphological traits associated with oxygen consumption, specifically gill surface area, have been shown to be correlates of oxygen demand and energy use, and thus may serve as integrated correlates of these processes, allowing us to assess whether evolutionary changes in brain size correlate with changes in longer-term oxygen demand and energy use. We tested how brain size relates to gill surface area in the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus. First, we examined whether the allometric slope of brain mass (i.e., the rate that brain mass changes with body mass) is lower than the allometric slope of gill surface area across ontogeny. Second, we tested whether gill surface area explains variation in brain mass, after accounting for the effects of body mass on brain mass. We found that brain mass and gill surface area both had positive allometric slopes, with larger individuals having both larger brains and larger gill surface areas compared to smaller individuals. However, the allometric slope of brain mass was lower than the allometric slope of gill surface area, consistent with our prediction that the allometric slope of gill surface area could pose an upper limit to the allometric slope of brain mass. Finally, after accounting for body mass, individuals with larger brains tended to have larger gill surface areas. Together, our results provide clues as to how fishes may evolve and maintain large brains despite their high energetic cost, suggesting that C. limbatus individuals with a large gill surface area for their body mass may be able to support a higher energetic turnover, and, in turn, a larger brain for their body mass.
564	34015863	Increased connectivity and depth improve the effectiveness of marine reserves.	Marine reserves are a key tool for the conservation of marine biodiversity, yet only ~2.5% of the world's oceans are protected. The integration of marine reserves into connected networks representing all habitats has been encouraged by international agreements, yet the benefits of this design has not been tested empirically. Australia has one of the largest systems of marine reserves, providing a rare opportunity to assess how connectivity influences conservation success. An Australia-wide dataset was collected using baited remote underwater video systems deployed across a depth range from 0 to 100 m to assess the effectiveness of marine reserves for protecting teleosts subject to commercial and recreational fishing. A meta-analytical comparison of 73 fished species within 91 marine reserves found that, on average, marine reserves had 28% greater abundance and 53% greater biomass of fished species compared to adjacent areas open to fishing. However, benefits of protection were not observed across all reserves (heterogeneity), so full subsets generalized additive modelling was used to consider factors that influence marine reserve effectiveness, including distance-based and ecological metrics of connectivity among reserves. Our results suggest that increased connectivity and depth improve the aforementioned marine reserve benefits and that these factors should be considered to optimize such benefits over time. We provide important guidance on factors to consider when implementing marine reserves for the purpose of increasing the abundance and size of fished species, given the expected increase in coverage globally. We show that marine reserves that are highly protected (no-take) and designed to optimize connectivity, size and depth range can provide an effective conservation strategy for fished species in temperate and tropical waters within an overarching marine biodiversity conservation framework.

568	33991089	High-efficacy, high-manufacturability human VH domain antibody therapeutics from transgenic sources.	Interest in single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) stems from their unique structural/pronounced, hence therapeutically desirable, features. From the outset-as therapeutic modalities-human antibody heavy chain variable domains (VHs) attracted a particular attention compared with 'naturally-occurring' camelid and shark heavy-chain-only antibody variable domains (VHHs and VNARs, respectively) due to their perceived lack of immunogenicity. However, they have not quite lived up to their initial promise as the VH hits, primarily mined from synthetic VH phage display libraries, have too often been plagued with aggregation tendencies, low solubility and low affinity. Largely unexplored, synthetic camelized human VH display libraries appeared to have remediated the aggregation problem, but the low affinity of the VH hits still persisted, requiring undertaking additional, laborious affinity maturation steps to render VHs therapeutically feasible. A wholesome resolution has recently emerged with the development of non-canonical transgenic rodent antibody discovery platforms that appear to facilely and profusely generate high affinity, high solubility and aggregation-resistant human VHs.
569	33989809	A lack of red blood cell swelling in five elasmobranch fishes following air exposure and exhaustive exercise.	In teleost fishes, catecholamine-induced increases in the activity of cation exchangers compensate for decreases in hemoglobin oxygen affinity and maximum blood oxygen carrying capacity caused by decreases in plasma pH (i.e., metabolic acidosis). The resultant red blood cell (RBC) swelling has been documented in sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and epaulette (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) sharks following capture by rod-and-reel or after a 1.5 h exposure to anoxia (respectively), although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To determine if RBC swelling could be documented in other elasmobranch fishes, we collected blood samples from clearnose skate (Rostroraja eglanteria), blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus), and sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens) subjected to exhaustive exercise or air exposure (or both) and measured hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, RBC count, RBC volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin content. We did likewise with sandbar and epaulette sharks to further explore the mechanisms driving swelling when present. We could not document RBC swelling in any species; although hematocrit increased in all species (presumably due to RBC ejection from the spleen or fluid shifts out of the vascular compartment) except epaulette shark. Our results indicate RBC swelling and associated ion shifts in elasmobranch fishes is not inducible by exercise or hypoxia, thus implying this response maybe of lesser importance for maintaining oxygen delivery during acute acidosis than in teleost fishes.
570	33989361	A systematic review of spatial habitat associations and modeling of marine fish distribution: A guide to predictors, methods, and knowledge gaps.	As species distribution models, and similar techniques, have emerged in marine ecology, a vast array of predictor variables have been created and diverse methodologies have been applied. Marine fish are vital food resources worldwide, yet identifying the most suitable methodology and predictors to characterize spatial habitat associations, and the subsequent distributions, often remains ambiguous. Our objectives were to identify knowledge gaps in fish guilds, identify research themes, and to determine how data sources, statistics, and predictor variables differ among fish guilds. Data were obtained from an international literature search of peer-reviewed articles (2007-2018; n = 225) and research themes were determined based on abstracts. We tested for differences in data sources and modeling techniques using multinomial regressions and used a linear discriminant analysis to distinguish differences in predictors among fish guilds. Our results show predictive studies increased over time, but studies of forage fish, sharks, coral reef fish, and other fish guilds remain sparse. Research themes emphasized habitat suitability and distribution shifts, but also addressed abundance, occurrence, stock assessment, and biomass. Methodologies differed by fish guilds based on data limitations and research theme. The most frequent predictors overall were depth and temperature, but most fish guilds were distinguished by their own set of predictors that focused on their specific life history and ecology. A one-size-fits-all approach is not suitable for predicting marine fish distributions. However, given the paucity of studies for some fish guilds, researchers would benefit from utilizing predictors and methods derived from more commonly studied fish when similar habitat requirements are expected. Overall, the findings provide a guide for determining predictor variables to test and identifies novel opportunities to apply non-spatial knowledge and mechanisms to models.
571	33984556	Simulating trophic impacts of fishing scenarios on two oceanic islands using Ecopath with Ecosim.	The ecological system conformed by the islands of Tenerife and La Gomera (Canary Islands) is characterized though the trophic network. The indicators obtained by the Ecopath model show a stressed and still developing ecosystem, probably related to inadequate management of the fisheries that takes place in this area, focused on high trophic level species. The Ecosim and Ecospace modules have been used to provide comparative assessment of three management scenarios addressed to evaluate the impact of fishing, both professional and recreational, on the marine ecosystem, as well as the spatial evolution of the fishing effort in a projection period going from 2021 to 2030, that can be applied in decision-making and planning in the short and medium term. In all the simulated scenarios, a drastic reduction in the biomass of pelagic species was observed, including the trophic guild of pelagic sharks that the model identifies as key species for the correct functioning of this marine ecosystem. Despite the existing information gaps, the results seem to confirm that the intense exploitation to which some functional groups have been subjected in the past has left its mark on the ecosystem, requiring a significant fishing effort reduction to attempt a recovery of the stocks. It is strongly recommended the implementation of a recreational fishing data collection system with less uncertainty, due to its significant role in the state of this ecological system.
572	33982309	Coastal dunefields maintain pre-Holocene genetic structure in a rocky shore red alga.	Most intertidal algae have limited dispersal potential, and areas that lack hard substratum suitable for attachment are thus expected to isolate regional populations from each other. Here, we used nuclear and mitochondrial genetic data to compare genetic structure in two co-distributed intertidal red algae with different dispersal potential along the South African coastline. Gelidium pristoides is divided into a south-eastern and a south-western evolutionary lineage separated by extensive, continuous sandy shoreline habitat adjacent to coastal dunefields. In contrast, Hypnea spicifera is genetically homogeneous throughout its range. In G. pristoides, the genetic breaks are associated with contemporary coastal dunefields. The age of the divergence event suggests that this may reflect the effect of older dispersal barriers, and that genetic structure was subsequently maintained by the formation of contemporary coastal dunefields.

Fishery pressure on nursery areas of smooth hammerhead in northern Peruvian coast have become a serious threat to sustainability of this resource. Even though, some management actions focused on conservation of the smooth hammerhead populations were proposed in recent years, their scientific foundations are often limited, and biomass of smooth hammerhead in Peruvian waters continues to decrease. To inform management and conservation, this study aims to evaluate the trophic niche of smooth hammerhead juveniles from three nursery areas in the northern Peruvian coast using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses.

575	33980873	Artificial insemination and parthenogenesis in the whitespotted bamboo shark Chiloscyllium plagiosum.	Non-lethal methods for semen collection from elasmobranchs to better understand species reproduction has accompanied the development of artificial insemination. Ejaculates (n = 82) collected from whitespotted bamboo sharks Chiloscyllium plagiosum (n = 19) were assessed and cold-stored raw or extended at 4 °C. Females (n = 20) were inseminated with fresh or 24-48 h cold-stored raw or extended semen and paternity of offspring determined with microsatellite markers. Insemination of females with fresh semen (n = 10) resulted in 80 hatchlings and 27.6% fertility. Insemination of females with semen cold-stored 24 h (n = 4) and 48 h (n = 1) semen resulted in 17 hatchlings and fertilization rates of 28.1% and 7.1% respectively. Two females inseminated with fresh or cold-stored semen laid eggs that hatched from fertilization and parthenogenesis within the same clutch. Parthenogenesis rate for inseminated females was 0.71%. Results demonstrate artificial insemination with cold-stored semen can provide a strategy for transport of male genetics nationally and internationally, precluding the need to transport sharks. Production of parthenotes in the same clutch as sexually fertilized eggs highlights the prevalence of parthenogenesis in whitespotted bamboo sharks and poses important considerations for population management.
576	33977550	Age and growth of the tropical oviparous shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum in Indonesian waters.	The brown-banded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum, is the most common shark caught in coastal commercial fisheries throughout Southeast Asia, yet there is a lack of the life-history information necessary for reliable stock assessments. The authors estimated growth rates and age at maturity using analysis of growth bands in vertebral centra. They trialled four different techniques to enhance the visibility and improve identification of the putative annual growth bands necessary for age estimation. The authors found that the burn method on whole vertebral centra provided the most readable and consistent results for age analysis. The logistic model was chosen as the best-fit growth model for age estimation of 330 individual C. punctatum from Indonesia. Several age verification methods, including marginal increment ratio and length-frequency analysis, were performed with the support of age validation through the use of calcein-labelled vertebrae from two sharks maintained in captivity. This study found that C. punctatum from Indonesian waters is a fast-growing species that can grow up to 18 cm year

578	33976769	Molecular characterization of marine and coastal fishes of Bangladesh through DNA barcodes.	This study describes the molecular characterization of marine and coastal fishes of Bangladesh based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene as a marker. A total of 376 mitochondrial COI barcode sequences were obtained from 185 species belonging to 146 genera, 74 families, 21 orders, and two classes of fishes. The mean length of the sequences was 652 base pairs. In Elasmobranchii (Sharks and rays), the average Kimura two parameter (K2P) distances within species, genera, families, and orders were 1.20%, 6.07%, 11.08%, and 14.68%, respectively, and for Actinopterygii, the average K2P distances within species, genera, families, and orders were 0.40%, 6.36%, 14.10%, and 24.07%, respectively. The mean interspecies distance was 16-fold higher than the mean intraspecies distance. The K2P neighbor-joining (NJ) trees based on the sequences generally clustered species in accordance with their taxonomic position. A total of 21 species were newly recorded in Bangladesh. High efficiency and fidelity in species identification and discrimination were demonstrated in the present study by DNA barcoding, and we conclude that COI sequencing can be used as an authentic identification marker for Bangladesh marine fish species.
580	33961877	Energy and corticosteroid mobilization following an induced stress response in an elasmobranch fish, the North Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias suckleyi).	The dominant corticosteroid in elasmobranchs, 1α-hydroxycorticosterone (1α-OHB), has a described role in mineral regulation but a presumptive role in energy balance. Energy demand in vertebrates following exposure to a stressor typically involves an immediate but transient release of glucocorticoids as a means of mobilizing available energy stores, usually in the form of glucose. Although a glucocorticoid role for 1α-OHB would be expected, direct glucocorticoid function of this steroid has yet to be reported in any elasmobranch. In addition, elasmobranchs also utilize the metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), which is thought to replace the role fatty acids play in most vertebrates as a predominant fuel source in extrahepatic tissues. To determine the mobilization of metabolites and corticosteroids during a stress event, North Pacific spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias suckleyi, were cannulated and held in a darkened isolation box to recover (24-48 h) before being subjected to an acute air exposure or corticosterone injection. Dogfish were then serially blood sampled at nine timepoints over 48 h. Glucose, β-HB, 1α-OHB, corticosterone, as well as lactate, pH, and osmolality were quantified in plasma samples.

Many sharks and other marine taxa use natal areas to maximize survival of young, meaning such areas are often attributed conservation value. The use of natal areas is often linked to predator avoidance or food resources. However, energetic constraints that may influence dispersal of young and their use of natal areas are poorly understood. We combined swim-tunnel respirometry, calorimetry, lipid class analysis and a bioenergetics model to investigate how energy demands influence dispersal of young in a globally distributed shark.

584	33948519	Study of correlation between 2D echocardiographic assessment of right ventricle and outcome of acute heart failure patients.	"BACKGROUND: Hospital length of stay (LOS) is a key determinant of heart failure hospitalization costs and performance of medical care quality. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction predicted poor outcome in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).
AIM: To study the effect of right ventricular function on length of hospital stay as a predictor in patients with acute heart failure.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in Cardiology Care Units (CCUs) in Zagazig University Hospital and Shark El Madina Hospital from September 2019 to February 2020, we included in this study 99 patients admitted with AHF. Clinical data and baseline RV function assessed by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and S' velocity were collected. Clinical comorbidities including worsening renal function (WRF) were monitored during hospitalization. The primary outcome was hospital LOS.
RESULTS: There was statistically significant correlation between WRF, right ventricular systolic dysfunction identified by TAPSE<16 mm and S' <9.5 cm/s and poor outcome in patients with acute heart failure including prolonged LOS.
CONCLUSION: Right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction as assessed by TAPSE and S' velocity and diastolic dysfunction were independent predictors of longer LOS in AHF patients. WRF had high prevalence among patients with AHF and associated with poor outcome in AHF patients and prolonged LOS."
585	33942302	First record of a potential neonate tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) at a remote oceanic island in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.	Tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) play an important ecological role as top predators, yet knowledge of their reproductive ecology is scarce. Here, the authors report the first observation of a potential neonate G. cuvier at Cocos Island, a predator-dominated oceanic island in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). The individual was detected using baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS). The cameras also detected female individuals potentially pregnant, suggesting that parturition may take place at or near the island. Nonetheless, it is still unclear if the presence of a single neonate is an isolated event or evidence that the species is using the island for reproduction.

Shark tooth enameloid is a hard tissue made up of nanoscale fluorapatite crystallites arranged in a unique hierarchical pattern.

To ascertain how scalloped hammerhead sharks make nightly migrations to their feeding grounds as many as 20 km from their daytime abode, a seamount, a sensor was developed that measured irradiance intensity within the spectral range and sensitivity of the vision of the species. Could the sharks guide their movements by sensing the polarity of irradiation energy radiated from the sun or moon that penetrated into the oceanic depths? Two sensory receptors, cones and rods, are present in the retina of sharks to enable them to see both during daytime and nighttime. The peak sensitivity of the cones is red-shifted due to the presence of these wavelengths during the former period, while their response is linear under the range of the high light levels also present at this time; the peak sensitivity of rods is blue-shifted due to the presence of these wavelengths during dawn, dusk, and nighttime and is linear over the complementary range of low light levels. Spectral response curves for these two receptors were determined for sharks, and an attempt was made to match those of the sensors to the shark's wavelength perception. The first sensor was matched to the photopic range using a photocell covered with a red-shifted gel filter; the second was matched to the scotopic range using a blue-shifted gel filter.
589	33913722	Light-Designed Shark Skin-Mimetic Surfaces.	Sharks, marine creatures that swim fast and have an antifouling ability, possess dermal denticle structures of micrometer-size. Because the riblet geometries on the denticles reduce the shear stress by inducing the slip of fluid parallel to the stream-wise direction, shark skin has the distinguished features of low drag and antifouling. Although much attention has been given to low-drag surfaces inspired from shark skin, it remains an important challenge to accurately mimic denticle structures in the micrometer scale and to finely control their structural features. This paper presents a novel method to create shark skin-mimetic denticle structures for low drag by exploiting a photoreconfigurable azopolymer. The light-designed denticle structure exhibits superior hydrophobicity and an antifouling effect as sharks do. This work suggests that our novel photoreconfiguration technology, mimicking shark skin and systematically manipulating various structural parameters, can be used in a reliable manner for diverse applications requiring low-drag surfaces.
590	33906922	The Functional Significance of Bacterial Predators.	Predation structures food webs, influences energy flow, and alters rates and pathways of nutrient cycling through ecosystems, effects that are well documented for macroscopic predators. In the microbial world, predatory bacteria are common, yet little is known about their rates of growth and roles in energy flows through microbial food webs, in part because these are difficult to quantify. Here, we show that growth and carbon uptake were higher in predatory bacteria compared to nonpredatory bacteria, a finding across 15 sites, synthesizing 82 experiments and over 100,000 taxon-specific measurements of element flow into newly synthesized bacterial DNA. Obligate predatory bacteria grew 36% faster and assimilated carbon at rates 211% higher than nonpredatory bacteria. These differences were less pronounced for facultative predators (6% higher growth rates, 17% higher carbon assimilation rates), though high growth and carbon assimilation rates were observed for some facultative predators, such as members of the genera 
591	33906010	Negative metal bioaccumulation impacts on systemic shark health and homeostatic balance.	Contamination by metals is among the most pervasive anthropogenic threats to the environment. Despite the ecological importance of marine apex predators, the potential negative impacts of metal bioaccumulation and biomagnification on the health of higher trophic level species remains unclear. To date, most toxicology studies in sharks have focused on measuring metal concentrations in muscle tissues associating human consumption and food safety, without further investigating potential impacts on shark health. To help address this knowledge gap, the present study evaluated metal concentrations in the gills, muscle, liver and rectal gland of coastal sharks opportunistically sampled from Brazilian waters and tested for potential relationships between metal bioaccumulation and general shark health and homeostatic balance metrics. Results revealed high metal concentrations in all four tissue types, with levels varying in relation to size, sex, and life-stage. Metal concentrations were also associated with serum biomarkers (urea, lactate, ALT, triglycerides, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphorus) and body condition, suggesting potential negative impacts on organismal health.
592	33904943	Concentrations of Silver, Chrome, Manganese and Nickel in Two Stranded Whale Sharks (Rhincodon typus) from the Gulf of California.	Concentrations of Ag, Cr, Mn and Ni were measured in tissues of two whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) stranded in La Paz Bay (LAP) and Punta Bufeo (PB), Gulf of California, during 2017 and 2018. The concentration range of Ni (0.012-1.12 µg/g ww) and Cr (0.16-5.21) in the epidermis of both specimens was lower compared to the concentrations found in the epidermis of whale sharks from East Africa. The whale shark from LAP exhibited higher levels of Mn (4.45 µg/g ww), Ni (0.284 µg/g ww) and Cr (5.21 µg/g ww) in the muscle compared to another filter feeder shark, the megamouth, from Taiwan and from Brazil. The highest concentrations of Ag were found in the heart (3.70) of the individual from LAP and in the filtering pads (1.93) of the shark from PB. Chromium in all selected tissues and the Mn found in the skeletal muscle, testicles (0.50), liver (Right lobe, 1.28; Left lobe, 1.63) and gills (1.54) of both sharks exceeded the limit established by the FAO/WHO for fish products.
593	33900630	Reproductive biology of the swell shark Cephaloscyllium ventriosum (Carcharhiniformes: Scyliorhinidae).	The Cephaloscyllium ventriosum shark is present in the artisanal fisheries of elasmobranchs on the western coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico. The main characteristics of the sexual maturation of this species based on individuals captured from off north-west Mexico in 2013-2016 are described. The size at maturity of this species was determined for the first time (total length 82 cm for females and 76 cm for males). Most females had one egg case per one uterus, and two per one uterus was an isolated event of low incidence. From the histological analysis of females, it was possible to show sperm storage in the oviducal gland. Fully developed sperm in immature organisms were identified in the testes. The main indicator of the maturity stage of males and their mating activity is the clasper. The present study provides evidence for a reliable estimation of the sexual maturity of these organisms, demonstrating the need for the combination of macroscopic and microscopic methods.
594	33893380	Projected shifts in loggerhead sea turtle thermal habitat in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean due to climate change.	It is well established that sea turtles are vulnerable to atmospheric and oceanographic shifts associated with climate change. However, few studies have formally projected how their seasonal marine habitat may shift in response to warming ocean temperatures. Here we used a high-resolution global climate model and a large satellite tagging dataset to project changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for loggerheads along the northeastern continental shelf of the United States. Between 2009 and 2018, we deployed 196 satellite tags on loggerheads within the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) of the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf region, a seasonal foraging area. Tag location data combined with depth and remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) were used to characterize the species' current thermal range in the MAB. The best-fitting model indicated that the habitat envelope for tagged loggerheads consisted of SST ranging from 11.0° to 29.7 °C and depths between 0 and 105.0 m. The calculated core bathythermal range consisted of SSTs between 15.0° and 28.0 °C and depths between 8.0 and 92.0 m, with the highest probability of presence occurred in regions with SST between 17.7° and 25.3 °C and at depths between 26.1 and 74.2 m. This model was then forced by a high-resolution global climate model under a doubling of atmospheric CO
595	33892372	Foraging depth depicts resource partitioning and contamination level in a pelagic shark assemblage: Insights from mercury stable isotopes.	The decline of shark populations in the world ocean is affecting ecosystem structure and function in an unpredictable way and new ecological information is today needed to better understand the role of sharks in their habitats. In particular, the characterization of foraging patterns is crucial to understand and foresee the evolution of dynamics between sharks and their prey. Many shark species use the mesopelagic area as a major foraging ground but the degree to which different pelagic sharks rely on this habitat remains overlooked. In order to depict the vertical dimension of their trophic ecology, we used mercury stable isotopes in the muscle of three pelagic shark species (the blue shark Prionace glauca, the shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus and the smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena) from the northeastern Pacific region.

597	33888703	Cooperation-based concept formation in male bottlenose dolphins.	In Shark Bay, Western Australia, male bottlenose dolphins form a complex nested alliance hierarchy. At the first level, pairs or trios of unrelated males cooperate to herd individual females. Multiple first-order alliances cooperate in teams (second-order alliances) in the pursuit and defence of females, and multiple teams also work together (third-order alliances). Yet it remains unknown how dolphins classify these nested alliance relationships. We use 30 years of behavioural data combined with 40 contemporary sound playback experiments to 14 allied males, recording responses with drone-mounted video and a hydrophone array. We show that males form a first-person social concept of cooperative team membership at the second-order alliance level, independently of first-order alliance history and current relationship strength across all three alliance levels. Such associative concepts develop through experience and likely played an important role in the cooperative behaviour of early humans. These results provide evidence that cooperation-based concepts are not unique to humans, occurring in other animal societies with extensive cooperation between non-kin.
599	33887072	A matter of size: the population structure of the smallest known living shark, Etmopterus perryi (Springer & Burgess, 1985), from deep waters off the Colombian Caribbean coast.	The dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi) is the smallest known described shark, and practically no information has been available on this species since first described in the mid-1980s. Therefore, the aim of this work is to describe, for the first time, the population structure regarding dwarf lanternshark in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. During deep-water research surveys conducted along the Colombian Caribbean coast, 87 stations were sampled using the swept area method. A total of 153 dwarf lanternshark individuals were caught in depths ranging from 230 to 530 m. This information was used to describe the size structures, morphological measurements including length-at-weight relationship, length at maturity in females and the spatial distribution of mean length and biomass of the species. The lengths of individuals ranged from 78.02 to 289.00 mm total length (TL), which is a new record of maximum length for this species. The spatial distribution of mean lengths and biomass distributions show high abundances and high relative mean lengths in the northeast area off Santa Marta and the area northwest of Riohacha. The mean biomass density in the whole prospected area was 5.52 kg km

602	33880274	Tourniquet Use in Animal Attacks: An Analysis of News Media Reports.	Background Animal attacks pose a significant public health problem in the United States. Non-venomous animals are the leading cause of mortality in these attacks, and extremity injuries leading to hemorrhage are a common pattern. The Stop the Bleed campaign advocates for public training in bleeding control tactics and public access to bleeding control kits. Controlling life-threatening bleeding, as promoted by the Stop the Bleed campaign, may be a method to reduce preventable death in these attacks. Methodology We searched the Nexus Uni database, which compiles international news media articles, to collect newspaper articles in the United States between 2010 and 2019 that referenced animal attacks on humans in which a tourniquet was applied. We screened articles to assess for inclusion criteria and isolated a single report for each attack. Results A total of 50 individual attacks met the inclusion criteria and were included for data collection. Overall, 92% (n = 46) of the victims survived the attacks, and the average victim age was 33. California was the most common location of the attacks (n = 12, 24%), sharks caused the most attacks (n = 26, 52%), and victims most often sustained isolated extremity injuries (n = 24, 48% for arm and n = 24, 48% for leg). Laypeople applied the most tourniquets (n = 29, 58%), and appliers most frequently used improvised tourniquets (n = 30, 60%). Conclusions While mortality in this series was low, there are hundreds of fatalities from non-venomous animal attacks each year. Equipping and training the at-risk public to stop bleeding may save additional lives. Future Stop the Bleed efforts should improve access to public hemorrhage control equipment and expand educational outreach to people engaged in high-risk activities with animals.
603	33875186	Ciguatera poisonings: A global review of occurrences and trends.	Ciguatera Poisoning (CP) is the most prevalent, phycotoxin related seafood poisoning across the globe, affecting between 10,000 and 50,000 people annually. This illness results from the consumption of seafood contaminated with lipid soluble toxins known as ciguatoxins (CTXs) that are produced by benthic dinoflagellates in the genera Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa. The present work reviews the global occurrence of CP events and outbreaks, based on both scientific and gray literature. Ciguatera prevalence is significantly underestimated due to a lack of recognition of ciguatera symptoms, limited collection of epidemiological data on a global level, and reticence to report ciguatera in CP-endemic regions. Analysis of the time-series data available for a limited number of countries indicates the highest incidence rates are consistently reported from two historical CP-endemic areas i.e., the Pacific and Caribbean regions, a situation due in part to the strong reliance of local communities on marine resources. Ciguatera-related fatalities are rare (<0.1% of reported cases). The vast majority of outbreaks involve carnivorous fish including snappers, groupers, wrasses, and barracudas. Since 2000, an expansion of the geographical range of CP has been observed in several areas like Macaronesia and east and southeast Asia. In some of these locales, random surveys confirmed the presence of CTXs in locally sourced fish, consistent with the concurrent report of novel CP incidents (e.g., Canary Islands, Madeira, Selvagens Islands, New South Wales). One characteristic of outbreaks occurring in Asia is that they often present as large disease clusters due to group consumption of a single contaminated fish. Similar observations are reported from the Indian Ocean in the form of shark poisoning outbreaks which often lead to singular types of CP characterized by a high fatality rate. Other atypical forms of CP linked to the consumption of marine invertebrates also have been documented recently. Owing to the significant health, socioeconomic and socio-cultural impacts of ciguatera, there is an urgent need for increased, standardized, coordinated efforts in ciguatera education, monitoring and research programs. Several regional and international initiatives have emerged recently, that may help improve patients' care, data collection at a global scale, and risk monitoring and management capabilities in countries most vulnerable to CP's toxic threat.
604	33873040	Evaluation of muscle tissue as a non-lethal proxy for liver and brain organic contaminant loads in an elasmobranch, the Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo).	Elasmobranch ecotoxicological investigations are complicated because accessing organs that accumulate organic contaminants is usually lethal. Several metrics among liver, muscle, and brain were evaluated to determine their relative organic contaminant loads and the efficacy of using muscle as a non-lethal proxy for liver. Liver contained the highest concentrations (368-4020 ng/g wet weigth [ww]) and greatest estimated total load of contaminants. Brain had higher toxin concentrations than muscle (4.18-84.2 ng/g ww versus 0.94-4.73 ng/g ww). Liver and brain were similar to each other in terms of contaminant detection occurrence and signature overlap, whereas muscle poorly reflected those of liver and brain. However, the identity of contaminants detected in muscle constituted those that substantially contributed to summed liver and brain concentrations. Thus, studies utilizing muscle as a non-lethal liver alternative to study organic contaminant exposure in elasmobranchs should craft questions with care, considering its limited ability to serve as an accurate proxy.
606	33853007	Investigating links between thermal tolerance and oxygen supply capacity in shark neonates from a hyperoxic tropical environment.	Temperature and oxygen limit the distribution of marine ectotherms. Haematological traits underlying blood-oxygen carrying capacity are thought to be correlated with thermal tolerance in certain fishes, and this relationship is hypothesised to be explained by oxygen supply capacity. We tested this hypothesis using reef shark neonates as experimental models because they live near their upper thermal limits and are physiologically sensitive to low oxygen conditions. We first described in situ associations between temperature and oxygen at the study site (Moorea, French Polynesia) and found that the habitats for reef shark neonates (Carcharhinus melanopterus and Negaprion acutidens) were hyperoxic at the maximum recorded temperatures. Next, we tested for in situ associations between thermal habitat characteristics and haematological traits of neonates. Contrary to predictions, we only demonstrated a negative association between haemoglobin concentration and maximum habitat temperatures in C. melanopterus. Next, we tested for ex situ associations between critical thermal maximum (CT
607	33852615	Marine communities of the newly created Kawésqar National Reserve, Chile: From glaciers to the Pacific Ocean.	The newly created Kawésqar National Park (KNP) and National Reserve (KNR) in southern Chile consists of diverse terrestrial and marine habitats, which includes the southern terminus of the Andes, the Southern Patagonia Ice Fields, sub-Antarctic rainforests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands, valleys, channels, and islands. The marine environment is influenced by wide ranging hydrological factors such as glacier melt, large terrigenous inputs, high precipitation, strong currents, and open ocean water masses. Owing to the remoteness, rugged terrain, and harsh environmental conditions, little is known about this vast region, particularly the marine realm. To this end, we conducted an integrated ecological assessment using SCUBA and remote cameras down to 600 m to examine this unique and largely unexplored ecosystem. Kelp forests (primarily Macrocystis pyrifera) dominate the nearshore ecosystem and provide habitat for myriad benthic organisms. In the fjords, salinity was low and both turbidity and nutrients from terrigenous sources were high, with benthic communities dominated by active suspension feeders (e.g., Bivalvia, Ascidiacea, and Bryozoa). Areas closer to the Pacific Ocean showed more oceanic conditions with higher salinity and lower turbidity, with benthic communities experiencing more open benthic physical space in which predators (e.g., Malacostraca and Asteroidea) and herbivorous browsers (e.g., Echinoidea and Gastropoda) were more conspicuous components of the community compared to the inner fjords. Hagfish (Myxine sp.) was the most abundant and frequently occurring fish taxa observed on deep-sea cameras (80% of deployments), along with several taxa of sharks (e.g., Squaliformes, Etmopteridae, Somniosidae, Scyliorhinidae), which collectively were also observed on 80% of deep-sea camera deployments. The kelp forests, deep fjords, and other nearshore habitats of the KNR represent a unique ecosystem with minimal human impacts at present. The KNR is part of the ancestral territory of the indigenous Kawésqar people and their traditional knowledge, including the importance of the land-sea connection in structuring the marine communities of this region, is strongly supported by our scientific findings.
608	33838806	Determination of starch crystallinity with the Fourier-transform terahertz spectrometer.	We measured the terahertz (THz) spectra of native, amorphous, and dried starches derived from corn and potato using the Fourier-transform (FT) system and compared these spectra to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Both native corn and potato starches had seven absorption peaks in the terahertz regions, but five peaks were observed in the amorphous states. While spectral changes slightly occurred in corn starch even after drying, increase and decrease in the terahertz peak intensities were obtained in potato starch during drying. Similar changes in both starches during amorphization and drying were obtained in the X-ray diffraction patterns, and the correlations were found between terahertz peaks and the X-ray signals. Since the intensity of the peak at 9.0 THz was correlated with crystallinity obtained using an X-ray diffraction (r
609	33835320	Streamlining Disease Risk Analysis for Wildlife Using the Shark Bay Bandicoot as a Model.	"Disease risk analysis (DRA) is a process for identifying significant disease risks and proposing measures to mitigate those risks. Although numerous methodologies for DRA exist, the IUCN Disease Risk Analysis Manual Jakob-Hoff et al. (World Organisation for Animal Health, Paris, pp 160, 2014) remains the gold standard for wild animal translocations. In some cases, however, constraints of time or resources demand compromises on the ideal methodology, and a cost-benefit assessment is required to determine the best approach. We propose a methodology modified from Jakob-Hoff et al. (World Organisation for Animal Health, Paris, pp 160, 2014) and Sainsbury and Vaughan-Higgins (Conserv Biol 26:442-452, 2012), using translocations of the Shark Bay bandicoot (SBB) (Perameles bougainville) as an example. In this study, 44 hazards were identified and described for Peramelidae species. We used hazard prioritization and ""scoping"" to develop a shortlist of hazards for detailed risk assessment, which excluded 35 of these hazards from further assessment. This approach enabled timely, efficient and cost-effective completion of the DRA while maintaining transparent evaluation of all disease risks. We developed a disease risk management strategy for SBB based on structured, evidence-based analysis of current information and established biosecurity practices and disease screening recommendations for future translocations. Our approach demonstrates a practical process for DRA and risk mitigation, which delivered management outcomes despite limited resources, variable knowledge of disease epidemiology and uncertain translocation pathways for the target species. Limitations are acknowledged, and further research will aim to objectively test this methodology compared to other available methods."
610	33834287	The application of an allogeneic bone screw for osteosynthesis in hand and foot surgery: a case series.	"INTRODUCTION: The allogeneic bone screw transplant is a new osteosynthesis device making the use of foreign fixation material obsolete for various kinds of indications. Moreover, it is integrated into the recipient bone by natural bone remodeling without harming the surrounding tissue. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the transplant for osteotomy and arthrodesis in hand and foot surgery and to evaluate the clinical importance of the device.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-surgeon case series of 32 patients who had undergone hand or foot surgery with the application of an allogeneic bone screw with an average follow-up time of 1 year is reported. Clinical data were reviewed to evaluate the pain levels and satisfaction of the patients and the frequency and type of complications occurring during the healing process. Routine radiography and computed tomography were reviewed to determine the fusion rate, the ingrowth behavior of the transplant and the possible occurrence of transplant failure.
RESULTS: High patient satisfaction was paired with low postoperative pain levels and a low complication rate. 97% of the patients were free of pain at the timepoint of the second follow-up examination, the mean time of recovery of full mobility was 50.1 ± 26.1 days after surgery. Wound healing disturbance occurred only in two cases. Bony consolidation of the osteotomy or arthrodesis gap as well as osseointegration of the transplant was seen in all cases. No transplant failure or transplant loosening occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of the allogeneic bone screw resulted in a 100% fusion rate while the patient burden was low. The transplant is safe and suited for various kinds of osteosynthesis in hand and foot surgery."
611	33815489	Antifouling Technology Trends in Marine Environmental Protection.	Marine fouling is a worldwide problem, which is harmful to the global marine ecological environment and economic benefits. The traditional antifouling strategy usually uses toxic antifouling agents, which gradually exposes a serious environmental problem. Therefore, green, long-term, broad-spectrum and eco-friendly antifouling technologies have been the main target of engineers and researchers. In recent years, many eco-friendly antifouling technologies with broad application prospects have been developed based on the low toxicity and non-toxicity antifouling agents and materials. In this review, contemporary eco-friendly antifouling technologies and materials are summarized into bionic antifouling and non-bionic antifouling strategies (2000-2020). Non-bionic antifouling technologies mainly include protein resistant polymers, antifoulant releasing coatings, foul release coatings, conductive antifouling coatings and photodynamic antifouling technology. Bionic antifouling technologies mainly include the simulated shark skin, whale skin, dolphin skin, coral tentacles, lotus leaves and other biology structures. Brief future research directions and challenges are also discussed in the end, and we expect that this review would boost the development of marine antifouling technologies.
612	33803132	The Ultimate List of the Most Frightening and Disgusting Animals: Negative Emotions Elicited by Animals in Central European Respondents.	Animals have always played an important role in our everyday life. They are given more attention than inanimate objects, which have been adaptive during the evolution of mankind, with some animal species still presenting a real threat to us. In this study, we focused on the species usually evaluated as the scariest and most disgusting in the animal kingdom. We analyzed which characteristics (e.g., weight, potential threat for humans) influence their evaluation in a nonclinical Central European WEIRD population (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic). The tested animals were divided into two separated sets containing 34 standardized photos evoking predominantly one negative emotion, fear or disgust. The pictures were ranked according to their emotional intensity by 160 adult respondents with high inter-rater agreement. The most fear-eliciting species are mostly large vertebrates (e.g., carnivorans, ungulates, sharks, crocodiles), whereas smaller fear-evoking vertebrates are represented by snakes and invertebrates are represented by arachnids. The most disgust-evoking animals are human endo- and ectoparasites or animals visually resembling them. Humans emotionally react to fear-evoking animals that represent a real threat; however, identifying truly dangerous disgust-evoking animals might be harder. The results also support a somewhat special position of snakes and spiders.
613	33793261	Are age differences in recognition-based retrieval monitoring an epiphenomenon of age differences in memory?	Older adults often demonstrate a monitoring deficit by producing more high-confidence memory errors on recognition memory tests. To eliminate lower memory performance by older adults (OA) as a candidate explanation, we studied how distinctive encoding enhances the retrieval-monitoring accuracy in older adults and younger adults (YA) under different delays (2-day delay for OA, 7-day delay for YA). Individuals viewed items consisting of four randomly selected exemplars (e.g., SALMON, BASS, PERCH, and SHARK) from a taxonomic category (e.g., FISH), one being designated as the to-be-remembered target. Participants were randomly assigned to two encoding conditions: Shared (generate a shared feature of all exemplars, e.g., GILLS) or Distinctive (generate a distinctive feature of the designated target). We collected retrospective confidence judgments (RCJs) after a five-alternative forced-choice (5AFC) recognition test, with the lures being either previously presented (old) exemplars or new category exemplars. Recall and recognition memory were better with distinctive encoding, with shared feature generation producing more high-confidence false alarms (HCFAs). Distinctive encoding dramatically reduced HCFAs and improved RCJ resolution. Comparison of OA with 2-day delay YA revealed age differences in HCFA consistent with previous studies. As important, age differences in memory for OA and 7-day delay YA were minimized, eliminating age deficits in HCFAs. Matching OAs to a subset of 7-day delay YAs on recognition memory produced additional evidence favoring the null hypothesis of age-equivalence in HCFAs. The results therefore indicated that age differences in recognition-based retrieval monitoring in a forced-choice recognition test are an epiphenomenon of age differences in memory.

Puncture mechanics can be studied in the context of predator-prey interactions and provide bioinspiration for puncture tools and puncture-resistant materials. Lionfish have a passive puncture system where venomous spines (dorsal, anal, and pelvic), the tool, may embed into a predator's skin, the target material, during an encounter. To examine predator-prey interactions, we quantified the puncture performance of red lionfish, 
615	33790944	Evolution of Matrix Gla and Bone Gla Protein Genes in Jawed Vertebrates.	Matrix Gla protein (Mgp) and bone Gla protein (Bgp) are vitamin-K dependent proteins that bind calcium in their γ-carboxylated versions in mammals. They are recognized as positive (Bgp) or negative (Mgp and Bgp) regulators of biomineralization in a number of tissues, including skeletal tissues of bony vertebrates. The Mgp/Bgp gene family is poorly known in cartilaginous fishes, which precludes the understanding of the evolution of the biomineralization toolkit at the emergence of jawed vertebrates. Here we took advantage of recently released genomic and transcriptomic data in cartilaginous fishes and described the genomic loci and gene expression patterns of the Mgp/Bgp gene family. We identified three genes, Mgp1, Mgp2, and Bgp, in cartilaginous fishes instead of the single previously reported Mgp gene. We describe their genomic loci, resulting in a dynamic evolutionary scenario for this gene family including several events of local (tandem) duplications, but also of translocation events, along jawed vertebrate evolution. We describe the expression patterns of

Through laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) the role of riblets in combination with the shark skin denticle is established for the first time. Our results show that smooth denticles behave like a typical rough surface when exposed to an attached boundary layer. Drag is increased for the full range of tested dimensionless denticle widths,
617	33781258	A universal power law for modelling the growth and form of teeth, claws, horns, thorns, beaks, and shells.	"BACKGROUND: A major goal of evolutionary developmental biology is to discover general models and mechanisms that create the phenotypes of organisms. However, universal models of such fundamental growth and form are rare, presumably due to the limited number of physical laws and biological processes that influence growth. One such model is the logarithmic spiral, which has been purported to explain the growth of biological structures such as teeth, claws, horns, and beaks. However, the logarithmic spiral only describes the path of the structure through space, and cannot generate these shapes.
RESULTS: Here we show a new universal model based on a power law between the radius of the structure and its length, which generates a shape called a 'power cone'. We describe the underlying 'power cascade' model that explains the extreme diversity of tooth shapes in vertebrates, including humans, mammoths, sabre-toothed cats, tyrannosaurs and giant megalodon sharks. This model can be used to predict the age of mammals with ever-growing teeth, including elephants and rodents. We view this as the third general model of tooth development, along with the patterning cascade model for cusp number and spacing, and the inhibitory cascade model that predicts relative tooth size. Beyond the dentition, this new model also describes the growth of claws, horns, antlers and beaks of vertebrates, as well as the fangs and shells of invertebrates, and thorns and prickles of plants.
CONCLUSIONS: The power cone is generated when the radial power growth rate is unequal to the length power growth rate. The power cascade model operates independently of the logarithmic spiral and is present throughout diverse biological systems. The power cascade provides a mechanistic basis for the generation of these pointed structures across the tree of life."
618	33780667	Structure of the paraplacenta and the yolk sac placenta of the viviparous Australian sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon taylori.	"INTRODUCTION: Viviparity (live-birth) has evolved from oviparity (egg-laying) multiple times in sharks. While most transitions from oviparity to viviparity have resulted in non-placental forms of viviparity, some sharks develop a yolk sac placenta during pregnancy. The Australian sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori) is a placental species that suspends embryonic development in a diapause for most of pregnancy.
METHODS: To identify structures involved in supporting rapid embryonic growth in late pregnancy, we examined uterine and placental morphology by light and electron microscopy.
RESULTS: Paraplacental uterine regions have morphological specialisations consistent with secretion and fluid transport between uterine tissues and the lumen. Uterine secretions in the lumen may be absorbed by the outgrowths on the embryonic umbilical cord ('appendiculae'), which are densely covered by microvilli. The placenta consists of uterine villi that interdigitate with the yolk sac and enhance the surface area available for fetomaternal exchange. The yolk sac does not invade the uterine epithelium, and the egg capsule remains intact at the placental interface, separating maternal and fetal tissues. Some placental uterine epithelial cells are secretory, and endocytic vesicles in the opposing yolk sac ectodermal cells suggest that nutrient transport is by histotrophic uterine secretion followed by fetal absorption. Respiratory gases, water and possibly small nutrients likely diffuse across the placenta, where maternal and fetal blood vessels are ~2 μm apart.
DISCUSSION: Placental structure in R. taylori is similar to most other sharks, but there are differences in cellular structures between species that may indicate species-specific placental transport mechanisms."
619	33778171	A Novel Think Tank Program to Promote Innovation and Strategic Planning in Ophthalmic Surgery.	"BACKGROUND: Continuous quality improvement is a pillar of all surgical groups. Innovation is a critical aspect to continuously improve, but traditional staff retreats have several disadvantages which limit their utility in identifying needs and developing innovative solutions. To address these challenges, we designed the novel Think Tank Program to spur innovation and strategic planning for an academic ophthalmology department including the Kellogg Eye Center 6 operating rooms.
METHODS: The Think Tank program is a structured seven-phase program for faculty in small teams to identify, innovate, and implement meaningful change. Participants brainstormed problems and possible solutions to those problems, formed teams, acquired data, and implemented meaningful change in clinical care, research, education, and administration.
RESULTS: The program generated 19 novel proposals and significant faculty engagement and discussion in improving the department. A case example of improving the operating room (OR) utilization resulted in improved OR utilization from 63.8% to 74.6% over a 3 month period before and after implementation. It also resulted in a reduction of cancelled or rescheduled surgeries within 2 weeks or surgery from 29.8% to 15.2%. This resulted in an estimated positive financial margin of over $141,000 to the institution in addition to improvement in patient, surgeon, and staff satisfaction with the quality of care.
CONCLUSIONS: Engaged faculty, critical data analysis, and value proposition analysis with data-driven metrics and accountability can result in a significant increase in OR utilization and reduction in surgical cancellations. Think Tank serves as a model transformative program to assist practices and institutions to best fulfill their mission while actively engaging and retaining their members."
620	33767831	Analysing detection gaps in acoustic telemetry data to infer differential movement patterns in fish.	"A wide array of technologies are available for gaining insight into the movement of wild aquatic animals. Although acoustic telemetry can lack the fine-scale spatial resolution of some satellite tracking technologies, the substantially longer battery life can yield important long-term data on individual behavior and movement for low per-unit cost. Typically, however, receiver arrays are designed to maximize spatial coverage at the cost of positional accuracy leading to potentially longer detection gaps as individuals move out of range between monitored locations. This is particularly true when these technologies are deployed to monitor species in hard-to-access locations.Here, we develop a novel approach to analyzing acoustic telemetry data, using the timing and duration of gaps between animal detections to infer different behaviors. Using the durations between detections at the same and different receiver locations (i.e., detection gaps), we classify behaviors into ""restricted"" or potential wider ""out-of-range"" movements synonymous with longer distance dispersal. We apply this method to investigate spatial and temporal segregation of inferred movement patterns in two sympatric species of reef shark within a large, remote, marine protected area (MPA). Response variables were generated using network analysis, and drivers of these movements were identified using generalized linear mixed models and multimodel inference.Species, diel period, and season were significant predictors of ""out-of-range"" movements. Silvertip sharks were overall more likely to undertake ""out-of-range"" movements, compared with gray reef sharks, indicating spatial segregation, and corroborating previous stable isotope work between these two species. High individual variability in ""out-of-range"" movements in both species was also identified.We present a novel gap analysis of telemetry data to help infer differential movement and space use patterns where acoustic coverage is imperfect and other tracking methods are impractical at scale. In remote locations, inference may be the best available tool and this approach shows that acoustic telemetry gap analysis can be used for comparative studies in fish ecology, or combined with other research techniques to better understand functional mechanisms driving behavior."

Two new species of the cestode genus Caulobothrium, collected from the duckbill eagle ray, Aetomylaeus bovinus, off Senegal, are described. Although postulated as sister taxa in an earlier molecular phylogenetic analysis, Caulobothrium multispelaeum n. sp. and Caulobothrium katzi n. sp., respectively, are among the smallest and largest members of the genus. The smaller species is unique among its congeners in possessing unusual medial longitudinal grooves along the dorsal and ventral surfaces of its strobila that develop into a tandem series of elliptical apertures on the posterior proglottids. The inner surfaces of these apertures stained positively with McManus' periodic acid Schiff in a manner similar to that seen in members of the distantly related lecanicephalidean genus Elicilacunosus. The larger species differs from its congeners in size, number of proglottids, and arrangement of bothridial loculi. Both new species were found to possess a small apical sucker on the anterior margin of each of their bothridia. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and frontal sections of a bothridium of Caulobothrium tetrascaphium suggests that this species also bears an apical sucker. Examination of the hologenophore of the species provisionally referred to as Caulobothrium n. sp. 5 in the earlier molecular analysis indicates it is conspecific with the recently described Caulobothrium pedunculatum, which was also determined to possess bothridial apical suckers. This leads us to suspect that this feature may be found to occur in all members of the genus. SEM of specimens of Caulobothrium for the first time indicates their bothridial surfaces are covered with filitriches of various sizes but lack spinitriches; spinitriches were seen only on the cephalic peduncle of C. katzi n. sp. The geographic distribution and host associations of Caulobothrium are expanded to include data now available for all species. The diagnosis of the genus is revised to include all of this information.
623	33757045	An annotated checklist of the chondrichthyans of South Africa.	An annotated checklist of chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, batoids, and chimaeras) occurring in South African waters is presented. The checklist is the result of decades of research and on-going systematic revisions of the regional fauna. The chondrichthyan fauna of South Africa is one of the richest in the world with 191 species, comprising 50 families and 103 genera. It consists of 30 families, 64 genera, and 111 species of sharks; 17 families, 36 genera, and 72 species of batoids; and, 3 families, 5 genera, and 8 species of chimaeras. The most species-rich shark families are the whaler sharks Carcharhinidae with 20 species followed by the deepwater catsharks Pentanchidae with 13 species. The most species-rich batoid families are the hardnose stakes Rajidae with at least 21 species followed by the stingrays Dasyatidae with 13 species. This monograph represents the first detailed annotated checklist of chondrichthyans from South Africa in over 30 years.
624	33751827	Immunogenicity and humanization of single-domain antibodies.	Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), the autonomous variable domains of camelid and shark heavy-chain antibodies, have many desirable properties as components of biologic drugs. However, their sequences may increase the risk of immunogenicity and antidrug antibody (ADA) development in humans, and thus, sdAbs are routinely humanized during development. Here, we review and summarize the available evidence regarding the factors governing immunogenicity of sdAbs and our current state of knowledge of strategies to mitigate immunogenicity risks by humanization. While several sdAb properties, including high homology of camelid V
625	33742259	Analysis of shark NCR3 family genes reveals primordial features of vertebrate NKp30.	Natural killer (NK) cells play major roles in innate immunity against viruses and cancer. Natural killer receptors (NKR) expressed by NK cells recognize foreign- or self-ligands on infected and transformed cells as well as healthy cells. NKR genes are the most rapidly evolving loci in vertebrates, and it is generally difficult to detect orthologues in different taxa. The unique exception is NKp30, an activating NKR in mammals that binds to the self-ligand B7H6. The NKp30-encoding gene, NCR3, has been found in most vertebrates including sharks, the oldest vertebrates with human-type adaptive immunity. NCR3 has a special, non-rearranging VJ-type immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain that predates the emergence of the rearranging antigen receptors. Herein we show that NCR3 loci are linked to the shark major histocompatibility complex (MHC), proving NCR3's primordial association with the MHC. We identified eight subtypes of differentially expressed highly divergent shark NCR3 family genes. Using in situ hybridization, we detected one subtype, NS344823, to be expressed by predominantly single cells outside of splenic B cell zones. The expression by non-B cells was also confirmed by PCR in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Surprisingly, high expression of NS344823 was detected in the thymic cortex, demonstrating NS344823 expression in developing T cells. Finally, we show for the first time that shark T cells are found as single cells or in small clusters in the splenic red pulp, also unassociated with the large B cell follicles we previously identified.
626	33740655	Using species connectivity to achieve coordinated large-scale marine conservation efforts in the Red Sea.	In the face of increasing anthropogenic threats, coastal nations need to reach common ground for effective marine conservation. Understanding species' connectivity can reveal how nations share resources, demonstrating the need for cooperative protection efforts. Unfortunately, connectivity information is rarely integrated into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs). This is exemplified in the Red Sea where biodiversity is only nominally protected by a non-cohesive network of small-sized MPAs, most of which are barely implemented. Here, we showcase the potential of using connectivity patterns of flagship species to consolidate conservation efforts in the Red Sea. We argue that a large-scale MPA (LSMPA) would more effectively preserve Red Sea species' multinational migration routes. A connectivity-informed LSMPA approach provides thus one avenue to unite coastal nations toward acting for the common good of conservation and reverse the global decline in marine biodiversity.

Shark skin is predominantly specialized for swimming and protection, with the dermal denticle being the main structure associated with these abilities. The dermal denticle is a mineral structure with a unique morphology for each species, which allows its use as a taxonomic tool. Few studies have investigated the microscopy aspects of skin and dermal denticles, considering the high diversity of sharks. Here, we investigated the three-dimensional morphoquantitative aspects and mineral composition of dermal denticles in different regions of the angular angel shark, Squatina guggenheim, using scanning electron microscopy and dispersive energy system. With the microscopy, we were able to observe that the dermal denticle morphology changes according to the area it is located. It was possible to describe the dermal denticles individually, from root to the crown, highlighting all of their individualities. Through the dispersive energy system, we showed the proportions of each mineral found in the denticle, by area, demonstrating the composition and the particularities of crown, body, and root, where whitlockite was described for the first time in elasmobranchs. In this way, the present study presented the specificities of the dermal denticles of S. guggenheim, as well sought to understand the different structure functions for the animal, thus assisting future research in animal morphology.

The human ingestion of mercury (Hg) from sea food is of big concern worldwide due to adverse health effects, and more specifically if shark consumption constitutes a regular part of the human diet. In this study, the total mercury (THg) concentration in muscle tissue were determined in six sympatric shark species found in a fishing vessel seized in the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 2017. The THg concentrations in shark muscle samples (n = 73) varied from 0.73 mg kg
632	33710489	Variation of essential and non-essential trace elements in whale shark epidermis associated to two different feeding areas of the Gulf of California.	The Gulf of California represents an important hotspot for whale shark (Rhincodon typus) aggregation. Anthropogenic activities and natural sources could expose sharks to high levels of trace elements (TEs). To determinate these levels in this endangered species, concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn (in ng/g ww) were measured in 130 whale shark skin biopsies and 44 zooplankton samples collected from two areas of the Gulf of California, Bahía de Los Angeles (BLA) and Bahía de La Paz (LAP) during 2016-2018. For biopsies, Zn exhibited highest concentrations in BLA (2016-2017, 298 ± 406; 2017-2018, 1959 ± 2545) and at LAP (in 2016-2017, 595 ± 554; in 2017-2018, 2642 ± 1261). On the other hand, Cd (BLA 2016-2017, 3 ± 3; LAP 2016-2017, 4 ± 3; BLA 2017-2018, 17 ± 14; LAP 2017-2018, 13 ± 10) and Pb (BLA 2016-2017, 7 ± 7; LAP 2016-2017, 15 ± 32; BLA 2017-2018, 69 ± 76; LAP 2017-2018, 7 ± 5) showed lowest concentrations. Significant differences in TE concentrations between sites and periods occurred. Arsenic found in shark biopsies from La Paz suggested enrichment and/or increased bioavailability in this area. Sex alone was not a significant factor in TE concentration; nevertheless, a sex-dependent difference in correlation of TE concentration and size was noted (negative in males, positive in females). This indicates feeding strategies of whale shark may be sex and size segregated. During 2017-2018, zooplankton and sharks showed enrichment in all TEs. Essential elements were not biomagnified by sharks. Lead was biomagnified through zooplankton. Strong positive correlation between selected elements indicates that Zn, Cd and Pb follow the same metabolic route in the sharks' body.
634	33693042	Case Report: First Evidence of a Benign Bone Cyst in an Adult Teckel Dog Treated With Shark Teeth-Derived Bioapatites.	Bone cysts are a very rare orthopedic pathology in veterinary medicine, the general prevalence of which is unknown. A unicameral bone cyst was diagnosed in an adult female Teckel dog with a limp that was treated surgically by filling the defect with marine bioapatites. The treatment was effective and at 8 weeks the defect had remodeled 50.24%. Eighteen months after surgery, the defect had remodeled 94.23%. The limp disappeared after surgery, and functional recovery was good in all stages after surgery. No adverse reactions were observed at the local or systemic level. This is the first report of a benign bone cyst in an lame adult female Teckel successfully treated with a novel marine bioapatite.

Proximity and size of the nearest market ('market gravity') have been shown to have strong negative effects on coral reef fish communities that can be mitigated by the establishment of closed areas. However, moray eels are functionally unique predators that are generally not subject to targeted fishing and should therefore not directly be affected by these factors. We used baited remote underwater video systems to investigate associations between morays and anthropogenic, habitat, and ecological factors in the Caribbean region. Market gravity had a positive effect on morays, while the opposite pattern was observed in a predator group subject to exploitation (sharks). Environmental DNA analyses corroborated the positive effect of market gravity on morays. We hypothesize that the observed pattern could be the indirect result of the depletion of moray competitors and predators near humans.
637	33675679	The hippocampal-entorhinal system represents nested hierarchical relations between words during concept learning.	A fundamental skill of an intelligent mind is that of being able to rapidly discover the structural organization underlying the relations across the objects or the events in the world. Humans, thanks to language, master this skill. For example, a child learning that dolphins and cats can also be referred to as mammals, not only will infer the presence of a hierarchical organization for which dolphins and cats are subordinate exemplars of the category mammals, but will also derive that dolphins are, at least at one conceptual level, more similar to cats than to sharks, despite their indisputable higher perceptual similarity to the latter. The hippocampal-entorhinal system, classically known for its involvement in relational and inferential memory, is a likely candidate to construct and hold these complex relational structures between concepts. To test this hypothesis, we trained healthy human adults to organize a novel audio-visual object space into categories labeled with novel words. Crucially, a hierarchical taxonomy existed between the object categories, and participants discovered it via inference during a simple associative object-to-word training. Using functional MRI after learning, and a combination of ROI-based multivariate analyses, we found that both the mid-anterior hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex represented the inferred hierarchical structure between words: subordinate-level words were represented more similarly to their related superordinate than to unrelated ones. This was paired, in the entorhinal cortex, by an additional signature of internalized structural representation of nested hierarchy: words referring to subordinate concepts belonging to the same superordinate category were represented more similarly compared with those not belonging to the same superordinate level: interestingly, this similarity was never directly taught to subjects nor it was made explicit during the task, but only indirectly derived through a logical inferential process and, crucially, contrasted the evidence coming from the definitional perceptual properties of the concepts. None of these results were observed before learning, when the same words were not yet semantically organized. A whole-brain searchlight revealed that the effect in the entorhinal cortex extends to a wider network of areas, encompassing the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, partially overlapping with the semantic network.

"Chondrichthyes occupy a key position in the phylogeny of vertebrates. The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of four species of sharks and five species of rays was obtained by whole genome sequencing (DNA-seq) in the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. The arrangement and features of the genes in the assembled mitogenomes were identical to those found in vertebrates. Both Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) analyses were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among 172 species (including 163 mitogenomes retrieved from GenBank) based on the concatenated dataset of 13 individual protein coding genes. Both ML and BI analyses did not support the ""Hypnosqualea"" hypothesis and confirmed the monophyly of sharks and rays. The broad notion in shark phylogeny, namely the division of sharks into Galeomorphii and Squalomorphii and the monophyly of the eight shark orders, was also supported. The phylogenetic placement of all nine species sequenced in this study produced high statistical support values. The present study expands our knowledge on the systematics, genetic differentiation, and conservation genetics of the species studied, and contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary history of Chondrichthyes."
642	33664360	High resolution biologging of breaching by the world's second largest shark species.	Basking sharks, the world's second largest fish, are endangered globally following two centuries of large-scale exploitation for their oily livers. In the northeast Atlantic, they seasonally gather in key sites, including the western Scottish Isles, where they feed on plankton, but their breeding grounds are currently completely unknown. Using high-resolution three-axis accelerometry and depth logging, we present the first direct records of breaching by basking sharks over 41 days. We show that basking sharks breach both during the night and day, starting at approximately 20 m depth and can breach multiple times in short succession. We also present early evidence of potential lateralisation in basking sharks. Given the energetic nature of breaching, it should have an important biological function, but this remains unclear.
643	33652098	N-terminal domain regulates steroid activation of elephant shark glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors.	Orthologs of human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and human mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) first appear in cartilaginous fishes. Subsequently, the MR and GR diverged to respond to different steroids: the MR to aldosterone and the GR to cortisol and corticosterone. We report that cortisol, corticosterone and aldosterone activate full-length elephant shark GR, and progesterone, which activates elephant shark MR, does not activate elephant shark GR. However, progesterone inhibits steroid binding to elephant shark GR, but not to human GR. Together, this indicates partial functional divergence of elephant shark GR from the MR. Deletion of the N-terminal domain (NTD) from elephant shark GR (truncated GR) reduced the response to corticosteroids, while truncated and full-length elephant shark MR had similar responses to corticosteroids. Swapping of NTDs of elephant shark GR and MR yielded an elephant shark MR chimera with full-length GR-like increased activation by corticosteroids and progesterone compared to full-length elephant shark MR. Elephant shark MR NTD fused to GR DBD + LBD had similar activation as full-length MR, indicating that the MR NTD lacked GR-like NTD activity. We propose that NTD activation of human GR evolved early in GR divergence from the MR.
644	33647737	Influence of culinary treatment on the concentration and on the bioavailability of cadmium, chromium, copper, and lead in seafood.	"BACKGROUND: Seafood present important advantages for human nutrition, but it can also accumulate high levels of toxic and potentially toxic elements. Culinary treatments could influence seafood chemical element content and element bioavailability. In this study, the influence of culinary treatments on the total concentration and on the bioavailability of Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in shark, shrimp, squid, oyster, and scallop was assessed.
METHODS: Boiling, frying, and sautéing with or without seasonings (salt, lemon juice and garlic) were evaluated. Total concentration and bioavailability of Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in seafood after all these culinary treatments were compared with those in uncooked samples. Analytes were determined by triple-quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS). An alternative to express the results avoiding underestimated or overestimated values was proposed.
RESULTS: The analytes concentration in seafood without culinary treatment varied from 0.0030 μg g
CONCLUSION: Cadmium concentration was reduced in scallop after some culinary treatments (reduction o 37-53% after boiling, frying, and sautéing), but bioavailability percentage was not influenced. The employed analytical method was adequate for the purpose, presenting import results for food safety assessment about the influence of culinary treatments on metals concentration and bioavailability in seafood."

647	33635770	Concurrent Delusions of Ocular Parasitosis and Complex Visual Hallucinations from Charles Bonnet Syndrome Treated Successfully with Aripiprazole in an Elderly Male: A Case Report.	"INTRODUCTION: Delusional parasitosis (DP) has been described as among the most challenging diagnosis to manage in dermatology and psychiatry literature. Patients with this perplexing and enigmatic condition present potentially to a wide range of specialties including primary or emergency care, dermatology, infectious diseases, neurology, and psychiatry. DP is probably underdiagnosed from patients' underreporting of symptoms of being infested with parasites, resulting from the associated social stigma. In addition, specialists who most often encounter these patients often possess low familiarity and comfort level in the diagnosis and therapy of this disorder. To our knowledge, we present only the fifth case of delusional parasitosis that was associated with complex visual hallucinations. Both concurrent conditions were treated successfully with aripiprazole. Interestingly, in all of these prior cases including ours, the patients were elderly (age range, 74-95 years). Delusions of ocular parasitosis has been described in fewer than 11 cases. When delusions occur concurrently with hallucinations, the differential diagnosis becomes even more challenging and may include schizophrenia, drug-induced psychosis, Lewy body dementia, and Charles Bonnet syndrome. Our patient's delusions of ocular parasitosis led to ocular damage and severe visual impairment because of his constant need to extract the parasites from his eyes. We speculate that the subsequent complex visual hallucinations that developed can best be understood as Charles Bonnet syndrome.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old healthy African American male complained of pests and bugs approximately 2 cm in size that infested the skin of his entire body. He also described the life cycle of these parasites, which jumped onto his eyelids and conjunctiva. He developed functional vision blindness from his unwillingness to open his eyelids as a result of his attempts to block the parasites. He was evaluated by dermatology, infectious diseases, ophthalmology, and psychiatry. All specialists agreed with the diagnosis of DP, and recommended antipsychotic therapy. They consistently dismissed the patient's symptoms as anything more than psychiatric, so the patient did not follow-up for further assessments or other therapies. Even months after the diagnosis of DP, he developed complex visual hallucinations. He described new visions in vivid detail: inanimate objects (buildings, jackhammers, torches, planes), animals (bears, doves, sharks), shapes (triangles, rectangles, omega, and mason signs). The objects interacted on high-definition landscapes such as oceans. He refused further psychiatric assessment because he felt strongly that the symptoms were infectious in nature and not psychiatric. However, a therapeutic relationship with his geriatrician was established through empathic communications, goal setting, and shared decision making. He even agreed to start treatment with aripiprazole 2 mg because the shared goal was symptom management of the concurrent delusional parasitosis and complex visual hallucinations. The slow titration of aripiprazole to 6 mg led to a 75% reduction in the delusions and hallucinations. He initially declined higher dosages of the aripiprazole because of sedation and personal wariness of medications in general. However, a therapeutic relationship was nurtured based on respect, careful listening, and provision of options. Eventually, he agreed to a higher dosage of aripiprazole and thus titrate antipsychotic therapy that he rejected when prescribed by the dermatology and psychiatry specialists. We attempted to approximate the 15-mg dosage that led to remission of symptoms in previous case reports."
648	33625732	Physiological response to capture stress in endemic Southern African catsharks (family Scyliorhinidae).	Fishing is the major threat to marine fish populations, particularly to higher trophic-level predators such as sharks. Many sharks, and other fish, are caught as commercial by-catch or for recreational purposes and then released; therefore, it is important to understand the effects of capture stress on their physiology and subsequent survival. Nonetheless, although important data have been collected for some sharks, there can be substantial interspecific differences, and the consequences of capture stress are still poorly understood for most species. In this study, the authors quantified the physiological effect of capture on four catshark species endemic to Southern Africa, which are regularly discarded as by-catch and targeted by recreational fisheries. Fifteen pyjama sharks, nine leopard sharks and nine shysharks were captured, and a blood sample was collected to measure their physiological response to capture stress. Stressed blood biochemistry was compared to samples obtained after the sharks recovered for 24 h in an underwater pen. Levels of pH and K
649	33624313	Loss of predation risk from apex predators can exacerbate marine tropicalization caused by extreme climatic events.	Extreme climatic events (ECEs) and predator removal represent some of the most widespread stressors to ecosystems. Though species interactions can alter ecological effects of climate change (and vice versa), it is less understood whether, when and how predator removal can interact with ECEs to exacerbate their effects. Understanding the circumstances under which such interactions might occur is critical because predator loss is widespread and ECEs can generate rapid phase shifts in ecosystems which can ultimately lead to tropicalization. Our goal was to determine whether loss of predation risk may be an important mechanism governing ecosystem responses to extreme events, and whether the effects of such events, such as tropicalization, can occur even when species range shifts do not. Specifically, our goal was to experimentally simulate the loss of an apex predator, the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier effects on a recently damaged seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay, Australia by applying documented changes to risk-sensitive grazing of dugong Dugong dugon herbivores. Using a 16-month-field experiment established in recently disturbed seagrass meadows, we used previous estimates of risk-sensitive dugong foraging behaviour to simulate altered risk-sensitive foraging densities and strategies of dugongs consistent with apex predator loss, and tracked seagrass responses to the simulated grazing. Grazing treatments targeted and removed tropical seagrasses, which declined. However, like in other mixed-bed habitats where dugongs forage, treatments also incidentally accelerated temperate seagrass losses, revealing that herbivore behavioural changes in response to predator loss can exacerbate ECE and promote tropicalization, even without range expansions or introductions of novel species. Our results suggest that changes to herbivore behaviours triggered by loss of predation risk can undermine ecological resilience to ECEs, particularly where long-lived herbivores are abundant. By implication, ongoing losses of apex predators may combine with increasingly frequent ECEs to amplify climate change impacts across diverse ecosystems and large spatial scales.
650	33616866	The interplay between inhibitory control and metaphor conventionality.	When a metaphor is first encountered (lawyers are sharks), several meanings are activated, but the literal ones (lawyers have fins) need to be inhibited to successfully compute the figurative meaning (lawyers are aggressive). With repeated exposure that metaphor becomes conventionalized, and its figurative meaning may be easily accessible without the need to inhibit the corresponding literal meaning. Thus, a central question in the field, and the objective of the current project, relates to how metaphor conventionality and inhibitory control contribute to metaphor comprehension. Participants completed a sense-nonsense task in which they indicated whether metaphorical and literal phrases had sensible meanings. In Experiment 1, participants also completed an inhibitory control task that assessed their ability to inhibit task-irrelevant responses. Participants with lower inhibitory control were slower at responding to more novel metaphors and faster at responding to more conventional metaphors compared with participants with higher inhibitory control. In Experiment 2, we used a dual-task paradigm to reduce participants' inhibitory control resources while performing the sense-nonsense task. Participants completed the sense-nonsense task concurrently with a different secondary task. This assessed their ability to evaluate phrases under low and high inhibitory load conditions. Performance on the sense-nonsense task was higher when processing more conventional than more novel metaphors when participants' inhibitory control processes were taxed in the high load condition. These findings suggest that inhibitory control does play a role in metaphor comprehension-the less conventional a metaphor, the more inhibitory skills are required to compute the figurative meaning.
651	33611809	Description of the chondrocranium of the silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis with comments on the cranial terminology and phylogenetic implications in carcharhinids (Chondrichthyes, Carcharhiniformes, Carcharhinidae).	The definition and scope of the genus Carcharhinus has undergone several changes over the years and recent molecular studies have questioned its monophyly by the inclusion of other carcharhinid genera. Although many descriptions of chondrocranium are available for Carcharhinus species, some inconsistences and divergences are found in the literature, mainly regarding the foramina of the orbital region. In this study, the chondrocranium of the silky shark, Carcharhinus falciformis, from specimens caught at the Brazilian coast and the terminology of its components is revised has been described. Chondrocrania of other Carcharhinus species and carcharhinid genera are also examined in order to investigate the phylogenetic significance of chondrocranial morphology. Three new anatomical terms and nine chondrocrania characters are proposed and described in detail. The chondrocranial morphology varies widely among Carcharhinus species mainly regarding the rostrum and nasal capsules. The chondrocrania of Prionace, Nasolamia, and Negaprion are similar to Carcharhinus species and reveal the need to further explore the relationships among these genera. Characters potentially informative for systematics are the shape of rostral node, the preorbital process, and the subethmoidal fossa, and the occurrence of an epiphyseal notch and foramen, and must be included in phylogenetic studies encompassing other carcharhiniforms.
652	33606847	Can late stage marine mortality explain observed shifts in age structure of Chinook salmon?	Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations have experienced widespread declines in abundance and abrupt shifts toward younger and smaller adults returning to spawn in rivers. The causal agents underpinning these shifts are largely unknown. Here we investigate the potential role of late-stage marine mortality, defined as occurring after the first winter at sea, in driving this species' changing age structure. Simulations using a stage-based life cycle model that included additional mortality during after the first winter at sea better reflected observed changes in the age structure of a well-studied and representative population of Chinook salmon from the Yukon River drainage, compared with a model estimating environmentally-driven variation in age-specific survival alone. Although the specific agents of late-stage mortality are not known, our finding is consistent with work reporting predation by salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis) and marine mammals including killer whales (Orcinus orca). Taken as a whole, this work suggests that Pacific salmon mortality after the first winter at sea is likely to be higher than previously thought and highlights the need to investigate selective sources of mortality, such as predation, as major contributors to rapidly changing age structure of spawning adult Chinook salmon.
653	33602486	Cephalochordates: A window into vertebrate origins.	How vertebrates evolved from their invertebrate ancestors has long been a central topic of discussion in biology. Evolutionary developmental biology (evodevo) has provided a new tool-using gene expression patterns as phenotypic characters to infer homologies between body parts in distantly related organisms-to address this question. Combined with micro-anatomy and genomics, evodevo has provided convincing evidence that vertebrates evolved from an ancestral invertebrate chordate, in many respects resembling a modern amphioxus. The present review focuses on the role of evodevo in addressing two major questions of chordate evolution: (1) how the vertebrate brain evolved from the much simpler central nervous system (CNS) in of this ancestral chordate and (2) whether or not the head mesoderm of this ancestor was segmented.
654	33601022	A new species of Grillotia Guiart, 1927 (Cestoda: Trypanorhyncha) from the spotted skate, Raja straeleni Poll, in South Africa.	A new species of Grillotia Guiart, 1927 was recovered from the spotted skate (Raja straeleni Poll) from the south coast of the Western Cape, South Africa. Grillotia sasciae n. sp. is described based on morphological and molecular data. This species most closely resembles species in the subgenus Grillotia (viz., Grillotia borealis Keeney and Campbell, 2001, Grillotia brayi Beveridge and Campbell, 2007, Grillotia dollfusi Carvajal, 1971, Grillotia erinaceus Dollfus, 1969, Grillotia musculara Hart, 1936 and Grillotia patagonica Menoret and Ivanov, 2012) in having four hooks per principal row and intercalary hook rows in the metabasal region of the tentacular armature, a band of hooks on the external tentacular surface, numerous proglottids, and the presence of an uterine pore, a hermaphroditic sac, and internal and external seminal vesicles. The molecular phylogenetic analysis of the partial 28S rDNA gene, confirms the morphological data as it also groups Grillotia sasciae n. sp. within the G. erinaceus species complex. Grillotia sasciae n. sp. is distinctive among all other valid species in the complex by having two enlarged, uncinate hooks in the basal armature, of a different shape and size from the remaining hooks 1(1') in the metabasal armature. In addition, the retractor muscle of Grillotia sasciae n. sp. attaches at the posterior region of the tentacular bulb rather than the middle portion, continuing posteriorly as seen in most congeners (viz., G. erinaceus, G. borealis, G. brayi, G. musculara and G. pantagonica). The new species is the seventh species within the subgenus Grillotia and the first record of a species of Grillotia from southern African waters.
655	33588955	Developmental fates of shark head cavities reveal mesodermal contributions to tendon progenitor cells in extraocular muscles.	Vertebrate extraocular muscles (EOMs) function in eye movements. The EOMs of modern jawed vertebrates consist primarily of four recti and two oblique muscles innervated by three cranial nerves. The developmental mechanisms underlying the establishment of this complex and the evolutionarily conserved pattern of EOMs are unknown. Chondrichthyan early embryos develop three pairs of overt epithelial coeloms called head cavities (HCs) in the head mesoderm, and each HC is believed to differentiate into a discrete subset of EOMs. However, no direct evidence of these cell fates has been provided due to the technical difficulty of lineage tracing experiments in chondrichthyans. Here, we set up an in ovo manipulation system for embryos of the cloudy catshark Scyliorhinus torazame and labeled the epithelial cells of each HC with lipophilic fluorescent dyes. This experimental system allowed us to trace the cell lineage of EOMs with the highest degree of detail and reproducibility to date. We confirmed that the HCs are indeed primordia of EOMs but showed that the morphological pattern of shark EOMs is not solely dependent on the early pattern of the head mesoderm, which transiently appears as tripartite HCs along the simple anteroposterior axis. Moreover, we found that one of the HCs gives rise to tendon progenitor cells of the EOMs, which is an exceptional condition in our previous understanding of head muscles; the tendons associated with head muscles have generally been supposed to be derived from cranial neural crest (CNC) cells, another source of vertebrate head mesenchyme. Based on interspecies comparisons, the developmental environment is suggested to be significantly different between the two ends of the rectus muscles, and this difference is suggested to be evolutionarily conserved in jawed vertebrates. We propose that the mesenchymal interface (head mesoderm vs CNC) in the environment of developing EOM is required to determine the processes of the proximodistal axis of rectus components of EOMs.
656	33587314	Shedding light on the deep: The case of the velvet belly lanternshark in the North Aegean Sea.	Main biological features were assessed for the first time in the deep-water shark Etmopterus spinax from Hellenic waters by examining 150 individuals caught incidentally in the bottom-trawl commercial fishery off Skyros island. Females outnumbered males and the overall sex ratio was 1.38:1. Females ranged from 122 to 311 mm in total length (L
657	33586211	An inconvenient tooth: Evaluating female choice in multiple paternity using an evolutionarily and ecologically important vertebrate clade.	Understanding mating systems is a pillar of behavioural ecology, placing the complex interactions between females and males into a reproductive context. The field of multiple paternity, the phenomenon whereby many sires contribute to an individual litter, has traditionally viewed females as passive players in a male-male competitive framework. With the emergence of feminist perspectives in ecological fields, novel alternative mechanisms and evolutionary theories across invertebrate and vertebrate taxa recognize females are active stakeholders in the reproductive process. Despite their evolutionary significance, ecological diversity and myriad reproductive modes, elasmobranch (sharks, skates and rays) research lags behind other fields regarding complex biological processes, such as multiple paternity which is often ascribed to convenience polyandry. Here, we layout hypotheses and resynthesize multiple paternity literature from a female and life history perspective to highlight how alternative mechanisms influence the predominance of multiple paternity across elasmobranchs. We draw upon parallels in other invertebrate and vertebrate taxa to demonstrate how female elasmobranchs can influence multiple paternity outcomes that benefit their reproductive success. Our article challenges dogma that has resulted from years of dismissing the female perspective as important and provides a framework for future advancement using more holistic approaches to studying mating systems.
658	33580294	Plastic Ingestion by the Small-Spotted Catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) from the South West Coast of the United Kingdom.	Plastic pollution has increased dramatically worldwide and is having a detrimental effect on a variety of marine organisms. This study contributes to the existing data on the ingestion of both macroplastics and microplastics by one elasmobranch species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), considering the occurrence in males and females. Plastics were extracted from the stomach and spiral valve of (N = 200, n = 100 females and n = 100 males) and analysed by visual observations. A total of 28 pieces of plastic were found with five pieces extracted from a single individual. Overall findings indicate that this shark species is vulnerable to some extent to plastic ingestion (6.5% frequency of occurrence), but different aspects, such as differences in plastic contamination levels of different locations and ability to regurgitate stomach content, may affect the results of similar studies.
659	33578809	Paracellular and Transcellular Leukocytes Diapedesis Are Divergent but Interconnected Evolutionary Events.	Infiltration of the endothelial layer of the blood-brain barrier by leukocytes plays a critical role in health and disease. When passing through the endothelial layer during the diapedesis process lymphocytes can either follow a paracellular route or a transcellular one. There is a debate whether these two processes constitute one mechanism, or they form two evolutionary distinct migration pathways. We used artificial intelligence, phylogenetic analysis, HH search, ancestor sequence reconstruction to investigate further this intriguing question. We found that the two systems share several ancient components, such as RhoA protein that plays a critical role in controlling actin movement in both mechanisms. However, some of the key components differ between these two transmigration processes. CAV1 genes emerged during Trichoplax adhaerens, and it was only reported in transcellular process. Paracellular process is dependent on PECAM1. PECAM1 emerged from FASL5 during Zebrafish divergence. Lastly, both systems employ late divergent genes such as ICAM1 and VECAM1. Taken together, our results suggest that these two systems constitute two different mechanical sensing mechanisms of immune cell infiltrations of the brain, yet these two systems are connected. We postulate that the mechanical properties of the cellular polarity is the main driving force determining the migration pathway. Our analysis indicates that both systems coevolved with immune cells, evolving to a higher level of complexity in association with the evolution of the immune system.
661	33574384	Shallow seamounts represent speciation islands for circumglobal yellowtail Seriola lalandi.	Phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits in response to heterogeneous environments has been observed in a number of fishes. Conversely, genetic structure has recently been detected in even the most wide ranging pelagic teleost fish and shark species with massive dispersal potential, putting into question previous expectations of panmixia. Shallow oceanic seamounts are known aggregation sites for pelagic species, but their role in genetic structuring of widely distributed species remains poorly understood. The yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi), a commercially valuable, circumglobal, epipelagic fish species occurs in two genetically distinct Southern Hemisphere populations (South Pacific and southern Africa) with low levels of gene-flow between the regions. Two shallow oceanic seamounts exist in the ocean basins around southern Africa; Vema and Walters Shoal in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, respectively. We analysed rare samples from these remote locations and from the South African continental shelf to assess genetic structure and population connectivity in S. lalandi and investigated life-history traits by comparing diet, age, growth and maturation among the three sites. The results suggest that yellowtail from South Africa and the two seamounts are genetically and phenotypically distinct. Rather than mere feeding oases, we postulate that these seamounts represent islands of breeding populations with site-specific adaptations.
662	33569175	Wound-healing capabilities of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and implications for conservation management.	Wound healing is important for marine taxa such as elasmobranchs, which can incur a range of natural and anthropogenic wounds throughout their life history. There is evidence that this group shows a high capacity for external wound healing. However, anthropogenic wounds may become more frequent due to increasing commercial and recreational marine activities. Whale sharks are particularly at risk of attaining injuries given their use of surface waters and wildlife tourism interest. There is limited understanding as to how whale sharks recover from injuries, and often insights are confined to singular opportunistic observations. The present study makes use of a unique and valuable photographic data source from two whale shark aggregation sites in the Indian Ocean. Successional injury-healing progression cases were reviewed to investigate the characteristics of injuries and quantify a coarse healing timeframe. Wounds were measured over time using an image standardization method. This work shows that by Day 25 major injury surface area decreased by an average of 56% and the most rapid healing case showed a surface area reduction of 50% in 4 days. All wounds reached a point of 90% surface area closure by Day 35. There were differences in healing rate based on wound type, with lacerations and abrasions taking 50 and 22 days to reach 90% healing, respectively. This study provides baseline information for wound healing in whale sharks and the methods proposed could act as a foundation for future research. Use of a detailed classification system, as presented here, may also assist in ocean scale injury comparisons between research groups and aid reliable descriptive data. Such findings can contribute to discussions regarding appropriate management in aggregation areas with an aim to reduce the likelihood of injuries, such as those resulting from vessel collisions, in these regions or during movements between coastal waters.
663	33568471	Overfishing and habitat loss drive range contraction of iconic marine fishes to near extinction.	Extinctions on land are often inferred from sparse sightings over time, but this technique is ill-suited for wide-ranging species. We develop a space-for-time approach to track the spatial contraction and drivers of decline of sawfishes. These iconic and endangered shark-like rays were once found in warm, coastal waters of 90 nations and are now presumed extinct in more than half (
664	33565624	Revisiting the paradigm of shark-driven trophic cascades in coral reef ecosystems.	Global overfishing of higher-level predators has caused cascading effects to lower trophic levels in many marine ecosystems. On coral reefs, which support highly diverse food webs, the degree to which top-down trophic cascades can occur remains equivocal. Using extensive survey data from coral reefs across the relatively unfished northern Great Barrier Reef (nGBR), we quantified the role of reef sharks in structuring coral reef fish assemblages. Using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, we explored the interactions between shark abundance and teleost mesopredator and prey functional group density and biomass, while explicitly accounting for the potentially confounding influence of environmental variation across sites. Although a fourfold difference in reef shark density was observed across our survey sites, this had no impact on either the density or biomass of teleost mesopredators or prey, providing evidence for a lack of trophic cascading across nGBR systems. Instead, many functional groups, including sharks, responded positively to environmental drivers. We found reef sharks to be positively associated with habitat complexity. In turn, physical processes such as wave exposure and current velocity were both correlated well with multiple functional groups, reflecting how changes to energetic conditions and food availability, or modification of habitat affect fish distribution. The diversity of species within coral reef food webs and their associations with bottom-up drivers likely buffers against trophic cascading across GBR functional guilds when reef shark assemblages are depleted, as has been demonstrated in other complex ecosystems.
665	33564038	North Pacific warming shifts the juvenile range of a marine apex predator.	During the 2014-2016 North Pacific marine heatwave, unprecedented sightings of juvenile white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) emerged in central California. These records contradicted the species established life history, where juveniles remain in warmer waters in the southern California Current. This spatial shift is significant as it creates potential conflicts with commercial fisheries, protected species conservation, and public safety concerns. Here, we integrate community science, photogrammetry, biologging, and mesoscale climate data to describe and explain this phenomenon. We find a dramatic increase in white sharks from 2014 to 2019 in Monterey Bay that was overwhelmingly comprised of juvenile sharks < 2.5 m in total body length. Next, we derived thermal preferences from 22 million tag measurements of 14 juvenile sharks and use this to map the cold limit of their range. Consistent with historical records, the position of this cold edge averaged 34° N from 1982 to 2013 but jumped to 38.5° during the 2014-2016 marine heat wave. In addition to a poleward shift, thermally suitable habitat for juvenile sharks declined 223.2 km

Specifically, we compared mouse forelimb buds with the pectoral fin buds of an elasmobranch, the brown-banded bamboo shark (
667	33559201	Mitochondrial DNA genome evidence for the existence of a third divergent lineage in the western Atlantic Ocean for the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas).	We report for the first time a highly divergent lineage in the Caribbean Sea for the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) based on the analysis of 51 mitochondrial DNA genomes of individuals collected in the western North Atlantic. When comparing the mtDNA control region obtained from the mitogenomes to sequences reported previously for Brazil, the Caribbean lineage remained highly divergent. These results support the existence of a discrete population in Central America due to a phylogeographic break separating the Caribbean Sea from the western North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and South America.
668	33556124	Modernising fish and shark growth curves with Bayesian length-at-age models.	Growth modelling is a fundamental component of fisheries assessments but is often hindered by poor quality data from biased sampling. Several methods have attempted to account for sample bias in growth analyses. However, in many cases this bias is not overcome, especially when large individuals are under-sampled. In growth models, two key parameters have a direct biological interpretation: L0, which should correspond to length-at-birth and L∞, which should approximate the average length of full-grown individuals. Here, we present an approach of fitting Bayesian growth models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), with informative priors on these parameters to improve the biological plausibility of growth estimates. A generalised framework is provided in an R package 'BayesGrowth', which removes the hurdle of programming an MCMC model for new users. Four case studies representing different sampling scenarios as well as three simulations with different selectivity functions were used to compare this Bayesian framework to standard frequentist growth models. The Bayesian models either outperformed or matched the results of frequentist growth models in all examples, demonstrating the broad benefits offered by this approach. This study highlights the impact that Bayesian models could provide in age and growth studies if applied more routinely rather than being limited to only complex or sophisticated applications.
669	33554450	Stopping Haemorrhage by Application of Rope tourniquet or inguinal Compression (SHARC study).	"OBJECTIVE: There are increasing numbers of shark attacks in Australasian waters, with death commonly resulting from uncontrolled lower limb bleeding. The present study aims to determine the most effective first aid method using immediately available resources for controlling lower limb haemorrhage, which could be provided by single unsupported rescuer.
METHODS: The present study was a clinical trial performed at a single tertiary referral hospital. Healthy volunteers who completed a screening questionnaire, a baseline popliteal velocity measurement and then consented were eligible. The present study used Doppler ultrasound to record the reduction in popliteal artery peak systolic velocity created by surfboard leg rope tourniquet and by inguinal region external compression in healthy volunteer subjects with and without a wetsuit. Leg circumference and sex data were also collected.
RESULTS: Pooled data from each intervention without and with a wetsuit showed that inguinal compression resulted in a mean reduction of popliteal artery peak systolic velocity of 89.7% (95% CI 83.9%, 95.5%) compared to leg rope application 43.8% (95% CI 34.5%, 53.1%; P ≤ 0.001). There was no significant influence by the wetsuit on effectiveness of either intervention technique.
CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that manual inguinal compression, an easily taught first aid technique, can reliably completely stop or substantially reduce blood loss in the setting of a lower limb injury and is superior to an improvised tourniquet."
670	33550570	Quantifying the unreported and unaccounted domestic and foreign commercial catch of sharks and rays in Western Australia.	Reliable catch information is scarce for most sharks and rays worldwide, with almost half of the stocks considered to be Data Deficient due to limited species-specific catch statistics. Western Australia (WA) hosts a diverse number of shark and ray species, some of which are considered to be threatened with extinction at a global level. Commercial catch statistics only account for shark and ray landings. The present study used the best available information to reconstruct unaccounted and unreported catches for 47 shark and ray taxa to better understand the impact of fishing. For some species, there was good agreement between reconstructed catches and reported landings, but overall reconstructed catches were 57% higher than those derived from official statistics alone, underestimating the actual extraction level for many species. The reconstructed catch time series provide the basis for the assessment of all species of sharks and rays captured in WA, including protected species that interact with commercial and recreational fisheries.
671	33549485	Merging Implementation Practice and Science to Scale Up Promising Practices: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Diffusion of Excellence (DoE) Program.	"INTRODUCTION: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Diffusion of Excellence (DoE) program developed and manages a framework for identification, replication, and diffusion of promising practices throughout the nation's largest integrated health care system. DoE identifies promising practices through a ""Shark Tank"" competition with winning bidders receiving external implementation facilitation. DoE further supports diffusion of successful practices across the VHA.
METHODS: This article presents results of a mixed methods implementation evaluation of DoE, focusing on program reach, program participation and decisions to adopt innovative practices, implementation processes, and practice sustainment. Data sources include practice adoption metrics, focus groups with bidders (two focus groups), observations of DoE events (seven events), surveys of stakeholders (five separate surveys), and semistructured interviews of facility directors, practice developers, implementation teams, and facilitators (133 participants).
RESULTS: In the first four Shark Tank cohorts (2016-2018), 1,676 practices were submitted; 47 were designated Gold Status Practices (practices with facilitated implementation). Motivation for participation varied. Generally, staff led projects targeting problems they felt passionate about, facility directors focused on big-picture quality metrics and getting middle manager support, and frontline staff displayed variable motivation to implement new projects. Approximately half of facilitated implementation efforts were successful; barriers included insufficient infrastructure, staff, and resources. At the facility level, 73.3% of facilities originating or receiving facilitated implementation support have maintained the practice. VHA-wide, 834 decisions to adopt these practices were made.
CONCLUSION: DoE has resulted in the identification of many candidate practices, promoted adoption of promising practices by facility directors, and supported practice implementation and diffusion across the VHA."
672	33545809	Prionace glauca skin collagen bioengineered constructs as a promising approach to trigger cartilage regeneration.	Representing a strategy of marine by-products valorization, based on isolation of biocompounds and assessment of biomedical applicability, the potential of blue shark (Prionace glauca (PG)) skin collagen to induce chondrogenic differentiation of human adipose stem cells (hASC) was investigated, with and without exogenous stimulation. For that, a cryogelation method was applied to produce highly interconnected porous 3-dimensional (3D) constructs made of collagen and collagen:hyaluronic acid (20:1). In vitro studies reveal that hASC adhere abundantly to the constructs which then suggests the early chondrogenic differentiation of those cells. These findings are supported by the mRNA expression encoding chondrogenic-related markers like Coll II and Sox-9 that are markedly upregulated at an early stage for both conditions, with and without exogenous stimulation. The introduction of hyaluronic acid (Hya) seems to play a crucial role at later time points, as shown by the evident immunodetection of aggrecan (ACAN), even without exogenous stimulation. It is hypothesized that the PG collagen itself can support chondrogenic differentiation at early time points, but exogenous stimulation is required to ensure phenotype maintenance. The present work highlights the relevance of using blue shark collagen biopolymer as a building block to produce highly effective temporary matrices for cartilage applications.
673	33538362	Using fisher-contributed secondary fins to fill critical shark-fisheries data gaps.	Developing-world shark fisheries are typically not assessed or actively managed for sustainability; one fundamental obstacle is the lack of species and size-composition catch data. We tested and implemented a new and potentially widely applicable approach for collecting these data: mandatory submission of low-value secondary fins (anal fins) from landed sharks by fishers and use of the fins to reconstruct catch species and size. Visual and low-cost genetic identification were used to determine species composition, and linear regression was applied to total length and anal fin base length for catch-size reconstruction. We tested the feasibility of this approach in Belize, first in a local proof-of-concept study and then scaling it up to the national level for the 2017-2018 shark-fishing season (1,786 fins analyzed). Sixteen species occurred in this fishery. The most common were the Caribbean reef (Carcharhinus perezi), blacktip (C. limbatus), sharpnose (Atlantic [Rhizoprionodon terraenovae] and Caribbean [R. porosus] considered as a group), and bonnethead (Sphyrna cf. tiburo). Sharpnose and bonnethead sharks were landed primarily above size at maturity, whereas Caribbean reef and blacktip sharks were primarily landed below size at maturity. Our approach proved effective in obtaining critical data for managing the shark fishery, and we suggest the tools developed as part of this program could be exported to other nations in this region and applied almost immediately if there were means to communicate with fishers and incentivize them to provide anal fins. Outside the tropical Western Atlantic, we recommend further investigation of the feasibility of sampling of secondary fins, including considerations of time, effort, and cost of species identification from these fins, what secondary fin type to use, and the means with which to communicate with fishers and incentivize participation. This program could be a model for collecting urgently needed data for developing-world shark fisheries globally. Article impact statement: Shark fins collected from fishers yield data critical to shark fisheries management in developing nations.

(2020) show that fast-exploring sharks forage in risky habitats, where they grow-fast-but-die-young. In higher risk environments, however, this personality-related pace-of-life-syndrome does not exist because neither fast- nor slow-exploring types venture out into risky areas. The study thereby reveals the key role of ecology as a mediator of personality-related pace-of-life-syndromes in the wild.
675	33536299	Accounting for body mass effects in the estimation of field metabolic rates from body acceleration.	Dynamic body acceleration (DBA), measured through animal-attached tags, has emerged as a powerful method for estimating field metabolic rates of free-ranging individuals. Following respirometry to calibrate oxygen consumption rate (ṀO2) with DBA under controlled conditions, predictive models can be applied to DBA data collected from free-ranging individuals. However, laboratory calibrations are generally performed on a relatively narrow size range of animals, which may introduce biases if predictive models are applied to differently sized individuals in the field. Here, we tested the mass dependence of the ṀO2-DBA relationship to develop an experimental framework for the estimation of field metabolic rates when organisms differ in size. We performed respirometry experiments with individuals spanning one order of magnitude in body mass (1.74-17.15 kg) and used a two-stage modelling process to assess the intraspecific scale dependence of the ṀO2-DBA relationship and incorporate such dependencies into the coefficients of ṀO2 predictive models. The final predictive model showed scale dependence; the slope of the ṀO2-DBA relationship was strongly allometric (M1.55), whereas the intercept term scaled closer to isometry (M1.08). Using bootstrapping and simulations, we evaluated the performance of this coefficient-corrected model against commonly used methods of accounting for mass effects on the ṀO2-DBA relationship and found the lowest error and bias in the coefficient-corrected approach. The strong scale dependence of the ṀO2-DBA relationship indicates that caution must be exercised when models developed using one size class are applied to individuals of different sizes.
676	33529364	A Third Luminous Shark Family: Confirmation of Luminescence Ability for Zameus squamulosus (Squaliformes; Somniosidae).	Since recently, shark's bioluminescence has been recorded from two Squaliformes families, the Etmopteridae and Dalatiidae. Pictures of luminescence, light organ morphologies and physiology of the luminous control have been described for species of the Etmopteridae and Dalatiidae families. In 2015, a third luminous family, Somniosidae, was assumed to present a bioluminescent species, Zameus squamulosus. Up to now, confirmation of the luminous abilities of Z. squamulosus is lacking. Here, the luminescence of Z. squamulosus was in vivo recorded for the first time confirming the bioluminescence status of the third luminescent shark family. Additionally, photophore histology revealed the conservation of the light organ morphology across the luminous Squaliformes. Light transmittance analysis through the placoid scale added information on the luminescence efficiency and highlighted a new type of bioluminescent-like squamation. All these data reinforced the likelihood that the common ancestor of Dalatiidae, Etmopteridae and Somniosidae may already have been luminescent for counterillumination purpose.
677	33529196	Influence of sex, age, and education on mood profile clusters.	In the area of mood profiling, six distinct profiles are reported in the literature, termed the iceberg, inverse iceberg, inverse Everest, shark fin, surface, and submerged profiles. We investigated if the prevalence of the six mood profiles varied by sex, age, and education among a large heterogeneous sample. The Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) was completed via the In The Mood website by 15,692 participants. A seeded k-means cluster analysis was used to confirm the six profiles, and discriminant function analysis was used to validate cluster classifications. Significant variations in the prevalence of mood profiles by sex, age, and education status were confirmed. For example, females more frequently reported negative mood profiles than males, and older and more highly educated participants had a higher prevalence of the iceberg profile than their younger and lesser educated counterparts. Findings suggest that refinement of the existing tables of normative data for the BRUMS should be considered.
678	33527665	Elucidating shark diets with DNA metabarcoding from cloacal swabs.	Animal dietary information provides the foundation for understanding trophic relationships, which is essential for ecosystem management. Yet, in marine systems, high-resolution diet reconstruction tools are currently under-developed. This is particularly pertinent for large marine vertebrates, for which direct foraging behaviour is difficult or impossible to observe and, due to their conservation status, the collection of stomach contents at adequate sample sizes is frequently impossible. Consequently, the diets of many groups, such as sharks, have largely remained unresolved. To address this knowledge gap, we applied metabarcoding to prey DNA in faecal residues (fDNA) collected on cotton swabs from the inside of a shark's cloaca. We used a previously published primer set targeting a small section of the 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene to amplify teleost prey species DNA. We tested the utility of this method in a controlled feeding experiment with captive juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) and on free-ranging juvenile bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas). In the captive trial, we successfully isolated and correctly identified teleost prey DNA without incurring environmental DNA contamination from the surrounding seawater. In the field, we were able to reconstruct high-resolution teleost dietary information from juvenile C. leucas fDNA that was generally consistent with expectations based on published diet studies of this species. While further investigation is needed to validate the method for larger sharks and other species, it is expected to be broadly applicable to aquatic vertebrates and provides an opportunity to advance our understanding of trophic interactions in marine and freshwater systems.
679	33512550	A method for making alignments of related protein sequences that share very little similarity; shark interleukin 2 as an example.	"An optimized alignment of related protein sequences helps to see their important shared features and to deduce their phylogenetic relationships. At low levels of sequence similarity, there are no suitable computer programs for making the best possible alignment. This review summarizes some guidelines for how in such instances, nevertheless, insightful alignments can be made. The method involves, basically, the understanding of molecular family features at both the protein and intron-exon level, and the collection of many related sequences so that gradual differences may be observed. The method is exemplified by identifying and aligning interleukin 2 (IL-2) and related sequences in Elasmobranchii (sharks/rays) and coelacanth, as other authors have expressed difficulty with their identification. From the point of general immunology, it is interesting that the unusual long ""leader"" sequence of IL-15, already known in other species, is even more impressively conserved in cartilaginous fish. Furthermore, sequence comparisons suggest that IL-2 in cartilaginous fish has lost its ability to bind an IL-2Rα/15Rα receptor chain, which would prohibit the existence of a mechanism for regulatory T cell regulation identical to mammals."
680	33511659	Morphometric description and biological notes on the rare kitefin shark Dalatias licha (Chondrichthyes: Dalatidae) from the Hellenic waters.	Deep-sea sharks are among the less studied and most endangered elasmobranchs existing in the Mediterranean Sea, and therefore scientific research should be prioritized towards this vulnerable group of species. The aim of this study is to provide a morphometric description of the vulnerable kitefin shark by recording 55 standard morphometric measurements and to present its main biological features based on the examination of six historical specimens that were captured as by-catch by commercial bottom trawlers in the Hellenic waters.
681	33511533	Sublethal, sex-specific, osmotic, and metabolic impairments in embryonic and adult round stingrays from a location exposed to environmental contamination in southern California, USA.	Organic contaminants are known to affect a suite of physiological processes across vertebrate clades. However, despite their ancient lineage and important roles in maintaining healthy ecosystems, elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) are understudied with regard to sublethal effects of contaminant exposure on metabolic processes. Perturbations resulting from contaminant exposure can divert energy away from maintaining physiological homeostasis, particularly during energetically challenging life stages, such as pregnancy and embryonic development. Using the round stingray (Urobatis halleri) as a model elasmobranch species, we captured adult males and pregnant females (matrotrophic histotrophy) and their embryos from two populations differing in their environmental exposure to organic contaminants (primarily polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)). Pregnant females from the PCB-exposed population experienced significant decreases from early- to late-pregnancy in tissue mass and quality not seen in reference females. PCB-exposed pregnant females also failed to maintain plasma urea concentrations as pregnancy progressed, which was accompanied by a loss in muscle protein content. Despite the energetic demands of late-term pregnancy, females had significantly greater liver lipid content than reproductively inactive adult males. PCB-exposed adult males also had high metabolic capacity (i.e., enzyme activity) for most substrate groupings of all sex-site groups, suggesting that males may be even more negatively impacted by contaminant exposure than pregnant females. Evidence that in utero exposure to PCBs via maternal offloading impairs embryo outcomes is accumulating. Embryos from the PCB-contaminated site had lower tissue quality measures and indications that sex-based differences were manifesting in utero as males had higher metabolic capacities than females. This study indicates that accumulated PCB contaminants are not physiologically inert in the stingray.
682	33506812	Scavenging versus predation: shark-bite injuries in stranded sea turtles in the southeastern USA.	Injuries inflicted by sharks are a frequent observation in stranded sea turtles. Sharks prey on live turtles and scavenge carcasses, which can create uncertainty as to the cause of stranding when sea turtles are found dead with shark-bite wounds. Consequently, attributing the cause of stranding to a shark attack based purely on the presence of the characteristic wounds can overestimate predation by sharks as a cause of mortality. To better characterize the timing of shark-bite wounds relative to death of sea turtles in the southeastern USA, we performed necropsies on 70 stranded turtles that were found dead in which the predominant observation was bite wounds without any grossly evident vital responses (inflammation or healing). Postmortem examination included assessment for evidence of exsanguination and histopathological evaluation of skeletal muscle comprising wound margins. We characterized wounds as antemortem, perimortem, or postmortem based on specific criteria related to the presence or absence of supravital and intravital responses. Most (80%) shark-bite wounds were postmortem, 10% were antemortem, and 10% were perimortem. We found that antemortem and postmortem wounds were similar in extent and location except for wounds that primarily involved the shell, which were never found in cases of scavenging. For sea turtles found dead in the southeastern USA, our findings suggest that most shark-bite wounds without externally evident vital responses are due to scavenging. Additionally, this scavenging can significantly damage a carcass, potentially obscuring the detection of other causes of mortality. These findings should be considered when using data derived from stranded sea turtles to conduct mortality assessments.

686	33491226	Protective effects of orally administered shark compound peptides from Chiloscyllium plagiosum against acute inflammation.	The anti-inflammatory effects of shark compound peptides (SCP) from Chiloscyllium plagiosum were investigated. Results showed that SCP enhanced the viability of RAW 264.7 macrophages in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Orally administered SCP exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice by suppressing serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), as well as nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, SCP significantly inhibited the inflammatory rise of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine (CRE), while blocking the decline of cholinesterase (CHE), with an efficacy close to aspirin. This research showed that orally administered SCP from C. plagiosum notably downregulated uncontrolled inflammatory responses, and conferred substantial protection from endotoxin-induced acute hepatic damage and renal functional impairment. Therefore, oral supplementation of SCP can be used as a preventive approach to reduce the risk of inflammatory-related diseases.
687	33489251	In-water observations highlight the effects of provisioning on whale shark behaviour at the world's largest whale shark tourism destination.	The whale shark is the world's largest fish that forms predictable aggregations across its range, many of which support tourism industries. The largest non-captive provisioned whale shark destination globally is at Oslob, Philippines, where more than 500 000 tourists visit yearly. There, the sharks are provisioned daily, year-round, allowing the human-shark interaction in nearshore waters. We used in-water behavioural observations of whale sharks between 2015 and 2017 to understand the relationship between external stimuli and shark behaviour, whether frequency of visits at the site can act as a predictor of behaviour, and the tourist compliance to the code of conduct. Mixed effects models revealed that the number of previous visits at the site was a strong predictor of whale shark behaviour, and that provisioned sharks were less likely to exhibit avoidance. Compliance was poor, with 93% of surveys having people less than 2 m from the animal, highlighting overcrowding of whale sharks at Oslob. Given the behavioural implications to whale sharks highlighted here and the local community's reliance on the tourism industry, it is imperative to improve management strategies to increase tourist compliance and strive for sustainable tourism practices.
689	33484056	The evolution of red blood cell shape in fishes.	The size and shape of red blood cells (RBCs) provide key information on life-history strategies in vertebrates. However, little is known about how RBC shape evolved in response to environmental factors, body size and the role of evolutionary rate. Here, we analysed RBC morphometrics in a set of Teleostei (bony fishes) and Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) species testing the hypothesis that phylogenetic relationship explains species occupation of morphospace. We collected data on cell and nucleus area and volume, nucleus:cytoplasm ratio and shape factor for 65 species belonging to 28 orders. Then, we built phylomorphospaces separately for bony fish and sharks and rays. To test whether phylogenetic relationships predicted phenotypic similarity, we calculated multivariate phylogenetic signal. We also estimated the evolutionary rate of RBC shape for each node and tip using ridge regression. Finally, we tested whether habitat and body size influenced RBC shape using a PGLS. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in RBC shape for bony fish, but not sharks and rays. Saltwater teleost species were more clustered than freshwater ones in the phylomorphospace, suggesting clade disparity. Accordingly, the rate of evolution was highly heterogeneous, with significant decrease in Acanthopterygii. Neither habitat nor body size influenced RBC shape. In conclusion, RBC shape seems to have evolved in fishes in response to multiple selective pressures independent of life-history characters.
690	33482662	On the influence of biomimetic shark skin in dynamic flow separation.	The effect of shark skin on the boundary-layer separation process under dynamic conditions (maneuvers) has been studied experimentally. We use a foil covered with biomimetic shark skin to explore how this type of surface impacts boundary-layer dynamics in both steady and accelerating conditions. The effect of denticles is assessed via particle image velocimetry in the wake. It is shown that dynamic conditions and small-scale disturbances can mitigate boundary-layer separation through instantaneous modification of the local pressure-gradient distribution. For instance, the region of favourable pressure gradient can be extended by accelerating the foil. The acceleration results in a thinner separated shear layer on the foil surface when compared to the steady reference case. This remarkable difference indicates that local roughness (introduced through for instance biomimetic shark skin) may trigger an interaction with relatively large-scale structures in the boundary layer for effective boundary-layer control during unsteady propulsion and maneuvering.
691	33482240	Do ectothermic vertebrates have a home in which to affinity mature their antibody responses?	There has been a longstanding question of whether affinity maturation occurs in ectotherms, and if it does, where in tissues this happens. Although cold-blooded vertebrates (ectotherms) lack histologically discernible germinal centers, they have a fully functional Ig gene mutator enzyme (activation-induced cytidine deaminase: AID or Aicda). Protein and Ig cDNA transcript analyses provide evidence that ectotherms can, under certain conditions, demonstrate antibody affinity maturation, and somatic hypermutation of their Ig genes during secondary immune responses. Here, we review the evidence for antibody affinity maturation and somatic hypermutation of Ig V(D)J exons. We argue that past evidence of long-term intact antigen retention, and recent studies of in situ expression of AID transcripts, point to fish melanomacrophage clusters as sites functionally analogous to a germinal center. Recent work in zebrafish provides a way forward to test these predictions through V(D)J repertoire analyses on isolated, intact melanomacrophage clusters. This work has implications not only for vaccine use in aquaculture, but also for antibody affinity maturation processes in all ectothermic vertebrates.
694	33476371	Examining the Relationship Between Conventional Outcomes and Immersive Balance Task Performance in Service Members With Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.	"INTRODUCTION: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is associated with significant financial cost and reduced military readiness and impacts quality of life for active duty service members (SMs). Post-concussive symptoms can include vestibular impairments, such as chronic dizziness and postural instability, which can be compounded by psychological comorbidities like PTSD. Comprehensive vestibular evaluations are required to assess symptoms and guide clinical decision-making. At the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE), in addition to traditional vestibular assessments, clinicians can also leverage virtual environments (VEs) in the Computer-Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) to further evaluate balance. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between conventional outcomes and VE performance on immersive balance tasks in the CAREN, determine whether VE performance could predict conventional outcomes, and explore the impact of PTSD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 112 SMs from the NICoE Intensive Outpatient Program who provided informed consent for their clinical data to be used for research purposes. All had a history of mTBI, underwent vestibular evaluations, and completed immersive balance tasks on the CAREN. Conventional outcomes included the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), Activities Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, and Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). The PTSD Checklist-Military Version was added to account for behavioral symptoms. Computer-Assisted Rehabilitation Environment outcomes included total time to complete the Balance Cubes VE, with the platform static (BC-Static) and with random platform motion (BC-PM) as well as composite scores for the Shark Hunt VE, with (SH-Recall) and without a recall task (SH-Standard). Statistical analyses included independent t-tests to determine group differences, Pearson's correlations to examine relationships between conventional outcomes and VE performance, and binary logistic regressions to determine if VE performance predicted conventional outcomes based on clinically relevant cutoffs.
RESULTS: SMs who took less time to complete BC-Static had better overall balance, indicated by higher ABC, SOT, and FGA scores (P <.001). Those with greater self-reported dizziness, higher DHI scores, took longer to complete BC-Static (P < .05). FGA and SOT, objective gait and balance, were similarly correlated to BC-PM performance (P <.001). SMs with higher SOT scores, better balance, also tended to have higher SH-Standard scores (P <.1). SMs, who were above normative SOT, FGA, and ABC cutoffs, completed BC-Static significantly faster than those below (P <.05). This remained true for BC-PM but was only significant for SOT (P = .004). Performance on BC-Static, BC-PM, and SH-Standard was significant predictors of SOT score. For SMs with comorbid mTBI and PTSD, increased functional disability was observed in conventional outcomes and diminished VE performance was noted.
CONCLUSION: Objective balance and gait, SOT and FGA, demonstrated the strongest relationships to immersive VE performance in the CAREN. Our findings suggest that these immersive balance tasks may be effective as an adjunct assessment to examine balance. Future work will focus on moving these VEs from the CAREN to a portable system, which could be more readily utilized in a variety of clinical settings, increasing accessibility."
695	33468214	Development and characterization of thirteen novel microsatellite markers for use in Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus), with cross-amplification in Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus).	"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this work are to isolate, develop, and characterize polymorphic microsatellite markers for use in Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus).
RESULTS: Thirteen microsatellite loci were successfully amplified and yielded multi-locus genotypes for 36 S. microcephalus individuals from Grise Fjord (n = 16) and Svalbard (n = 20). Each locus yielded between 2 and 9 alleles and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.11 to 0.70 when estimated across both sites. One locus and three loci deviated from HWE following Bonferroni correction, for individuals sampled from Grise Fjord and Svalbard, respectively. Cross-amplification was successful at every locus for five of the ten S. pacificus individuals."

Climate-driven expansions of ocean hypoxic zones are predicted to concentrate pelagic fish in oxygenated surface layers, but how expanding hypoxia and fisheries will interact to affect threatened pelagic sharks remains unknown. Here, analysis of satellite-tracked blue sharks and environmental modelling in the eastern tropical Atlantic oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) shows shark maximum dive depths decreased due to combined effects of decreasing dissolved oxygen (DO) at depth, high sea surface temperatures, and increased surface-layer net primary production. Multiple factors associated with climate-driven deoxygenation contributed to blue shark vertical habitat compression, potentially increasing their vulnerability to surface fisheries. Greater intensity of longline fishing effort occurred above the OMZ compared to adjacent waters. Higher shark catches were associated with strong DO gradients, suggesting potential aggregation along suitable DO gradients contributed to habitat compression and higher fishing-induced mortality. Fisheries controls to counteract deoxygenation effects on shark catches will be needed as oceans continue warming.

705	35424313	Thriving artificial underwater drag-reduction materials inspired from aquatic animals: progresses and challenges.	In the past decades, drag-reduction surfaces have attracted more and more attention due to their potentiality and wide applications in various fields such as traffic, energy transportation, agriculture, textile industry, and military. However, there are still some drag-reduction materials that need to be deeply explored. Fortunately, natural creatures always have the best properties after long-term evolution; aquatic organisms have diversified surface microstructures and drag-reducing materials, which provide design templates for the development of thriving artificial underwater drag-reduction materials. Aquatic animals are tamed by the current while fighting against the water, and thus have excellent drag reduction that is unparalleled in water. Inspired by biological principles, using aquatic animals as a bionic object to develop and reduce frictional resistance in fluids has attracted more attention in the past few years. More and more aquatic animals bring new inspiration for drag-reduction surfaces and a tremendous amount of research effort has been put into the study of surface drag-reduction, with an aim to seek the surface structure with the best drag-reduction effect and explore the drag-reduction mechanism. This present paper reviews the research on drag-reduction surfaces inspired by aquatic animals, including sharks, dolphins, and other aquatic animals. Aquatic animals as bionic objects are described in detail, with a discussion on the drag-reduction mechanism and drag-reduction effect to understand the development of underwater drag-reduction fully. In bionic manufacturing, the effective combination of various preparation methods is summarized. Moreover, bionic surfaces are briefly explained in terms of traffic, energy sources, sports, and agriculture. In the end, both existing problems in bionic research and future research prospects are proposed. This paper may provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of the current research status of aquatic animals-inspired drag reduction.

707	33449123	Lost structural and functional inter-relationships between Ig and TCR loci in mammals revealed in sharks.	Immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (TCR) have obvious structural similarities as well as similar immunogenetic diversification and selection mechanisms. Nevertheless, the two receptor systems and the loci that encode them are distinct in humans and classical murine models, and the gene segments comprising each repertoire are mutually exclusive. Additionally, while both B and T cells employ recombination-activating genes (RAG) for primary diversification, immunoglobulins are afforded a supplementary set of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated diversification tools. As the oldest-emerging vertebrates sharing the same adaptive B and T cell receptor systems as humans, extant cartilaginous fishes allow a potential view of the ancestral immune system. In this review, we discuss breakthroughs we have made in studies of nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) T cell receptors demonstrating substantial integration of loci and diversification mechanisms in primordial B and T cell repertoires. We survey these findings in this shark model where they were first described, while noting corroborating examples in other vertebrate groups. We also consider other examples where the gnathostome common ancestry of the B and T cell receptor systems have allowed dovetailing of genomic elements and AID-based diversification approaches for the TCR. The cartilaginous fish seem to have retained this T/B cell plasticity to a greater extent than more derived vertebrate groups, but representatives in all vertebrate taxa except bony fish and placental mammals show such plasticity.
708	33447940	Mercury in neonatal and juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Part II: Effects assessment.	As apex predators, blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) are highly susceptible to biomagnified mercury (Hg) particularly in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), which is known to contain fishes and invertebrates with elevated Hg levels. Blacktip sharks occur in the GOM year-round and are heavily fished both commercially and recreationally, but little is known about how Hg affects the species. In this study, blood, muscle, liver, and kidney samples were collected from neonatal (n = 57) and juvenile (n = 13) blacktip sharks in Charlotte Harbor, Florida. Hg concentrations in neonates and juveniles were found to be elevated in muscle (mean ± SE = 0.59 ± 0.23 mg kg
709	33441855	Cross-sectional anatomy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the banded houndshark (Triakis scyllium).	Due to their important phylogenetic position among extant vertebrates, sharks are an invaluable group in evolutionary developmental biology studies. A thorough understanding of shark anatomy is essential to facilitate these studies and documentation of this iconic taxon. With the increasing availability of cross-sectional imaging techniques, the complicated anatomy of both cartilaginous and soft tissues can be analyzed non-invasively, quickly, and accurately. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed anatomical description of the normal banded houndshark (Triakis scyllium) using computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) along with cryosection images. Three banded houndsharks were scanned using a 64-detector row spiral CT scanner and a 3 T MRI scanner. All images were digitally stored and assessed using open-source Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine viewer software in the transverse, sagittal, and dorsal dimensions. The banded houndshark cadavers were then cryosectioned at approximately 1-cm intervals. Corresponding transverse cryosection images were chosen to identify the best anatomical correlations for transverse CT and MRI images. The resulting images provided excellent detail of the major anatomical structures of the banded houndshark. The illustrations in the present study could be considered as a useful reference for interpretation of normal and pathological imaging studies of sharks.
710	33441828	Biomechanical insights into the dentition of megatooth sharks (Lamniformes: Otodontidae).	The evolution of gigantism in extinct otodontid sharks was paralleled by a series of drastic modifications in their dentition including widening of the crowns, loss of lateral cusplets, and acquisition of serrated cutting edges. These traits have generally been interpreted as key functional features that enabled the transition from piscivory to more energetic diets based on marine mammals, ultimately leading to the evolution of titanic body sizes in the most recent forms (including the emblematic Otodus megalodon). To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluate the biomechanics of the anterior, lateral, and posterior teeth of five otodontid species under different loading conditions by using two-dimensional finite element analysis. Stress distribution patterns are remarkably similar among all models under puncture and draw (i.e., when subjected to vertical and lateral forces, respectively). Contrary to expectation, higher average stress values are detected under both loading scenarios in more recent species. Altogether, this suggests little correlation between tooth morphology and key aspects of biomechanical behaviour in otodontids, making it difficult to frame the morphological trend of their dentitions within an adaptive scenario. We propose that this pattern most likely emerged as a non-functional by-product of heterochronic processes driven by selection towards larger body sizes.
711	33441580	The impact of injury on apparent survival of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) in South Ari Atoll Marine Protected Area, Maldives.	The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is an endangered species with a declining global population. The South Ari Atoll Marine Protected Area (SAMPA), Maldives, is one of few locations globally where year-long residency of individuals occurs. This SAMPA aggregation appears to consist almost exclusively of immature males. Due to its year-round residency, this local aggregation is subjected to a high degree of tourism pressure. This ecotourism contributes to the high level of interest and protection offered to whale sharks by the local community. Unfortunately, if regulations are not followed or enforced, tourism can bring with it major stressors, such as accidental injuries. We used POPAN capture-mark-recapture models and lagged identification rate analysis to assess the effect of major injuries on whale shark residency within SAMPA. Injuries may be obtained outside SAMPA. We found individuals with major injuries had a higher apparent survival in the area than those without. Lagged identification rates also demonstrated that sharks with major injuries are more likely to return to the area. We suggest that major injuries result in sharks prolonging their time in the developmental habitat. These findings have implications for individual fitness and the population viability of this endangered species. We propose targeted conservation strategies be considered to protect sharks from further injury. Based on the presented spatio-temporal distributions of sharks, and current local knowledge of sighting patterns, speed limit zones and propeller-exclusion zones should be implemented and enforced. If carried out alongside tourist education, these measures will contribute to the protection of whale sharks within SAMPA and beyond. Furthermore, our results can aid research direction, alongside regulation and enforcement development, at similar sites worldwide.

Understanding how these changes potentially cascade across marine and freshwater ecosystems requires knowing how mobile euryhaline species link these seemingly disparate systems. As upper trophic level predators, bull sharks (
715	33436769	Future thermal regimes for epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum): growth and metabolic performance cease to be optimal.	Climate change is affecting thermal regimes globally, and organisms relying on their environment to regulate biological processes face unknown consequences. In ectotherms, temperature affects development rates, body condition, and performance. Embryonic stages may be the most vulnerable life history stages, especially for oviparous species already living at the warm edge of their distribution, as embryos cannot relocate during this developmental window. We reared 27 epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) embryos under average summer conditions (27 °C) or temperatures predicted for the middle and end of the twenty-first century with climate change (i.e., 29 and 31 °C) and tracked growth, development, and metabolic costs both in ovo and upon hatch. Rearing sharks at 31 °C impacted embryonic growth, yolk consumption, and metabolic rates. Upon hatch, 31 °C-reared sharks weighed significantly less than their 27 °C-reared counterparts and exhibited reduced metabolic performance. Many important growth and development traits in this species may peak after 27 °C and start to become negatively impacted nearing 31 °C. We hypothesize that 31 °C approximates the pejus temperature (i.e., temperatures at which performance of a trait begin to decline) for this species, which is alarming, given that this temperature range is well within ocean warming scenarios predicted for this species' distribution over the next century.
716	33434468	Rebound in functional distinctiveness following warming and reduced fishing in the North Sea.	Functionally distinct species (i.e. species with unique trait combinations in the community) can support important ecological roles and contribute disproportionately to ecosystem functioning. Yet, how functionally distinct species have responded to recent climate change and human exploitation has been widely overlooked. Here, using ecological traits and long-term fish data in the North Sea, we identified functionally distinct and functionally common species, and evaluated their spatial and temporal dynamics in relation to environmental variables and fishing pressure. Functionally distinct species were characterized by late sexual maturity, few, large offspring, and high parental care, many being sharks and skates that play critical roles in structuring food webs. Both functionally distinct and functionally common species increased in abundance as ocean temperatures warmed and fishing pressure decreased over the last three decades; however, functionally distinct species increased throughout the North Sea, but primarily in southern North Sea where fishing was historically most intense, indicating a rebound following fleet decommissioning and reduced harvesting. Yet, some of the most functionally distinct species are currently listed as threatened by the IUCN and considered highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Alarmingly these species have not rebounded. This work highlights the relevance and potential of integrating functional distinctiveness into ecosystem management and conservation prioritization.
717	33431597	Latency of mechanically stimulated escape responses in the Pacific spiny dogfish, Squalus suckleyi.	Fast escape responses to a predator threat are fundamental to the survival of mobile marine organisms. However, elasmobranchs are often underrepresented in such studies. Here, we measured the escape latency (time interval between the stimulus and first visible reaction) of mechanically induced escape responses in the Pacific spiny dogfish, 
718	33423198	Trace elements in muscle tissue of three commercial shark species: Prionace glauca, Carcharhinus falciformis, and Alopias pelagicus off the Manzanillo, Colima coast, Mexico.	Given their predatory characteristics, long life, and high trophic levels, sharks can have a remarkable ability to bioaccumulate and/or biomagnify trace elements (TE). In the present study, 13 TE (Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, As, Se, Zn, Cr, V, Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) were analyzed in the muscle tissue of three shark species (Prionace glauca, Carcharhinus falciformis, and Alopias pelagicus) using high-resolution mass spectrometry inductively coupled to a plasma generator (HR-ICP-MS); 30 shark specimens of each specie were obtained during commercial fish landings in the port of Manzanillo, Mexico. The morphometric characteristics and sex of the sharks were recorded. Shark A. pelagicus accumulated higher concentrations of TE, especially for Hg and Cd, than the other species. Significant differences in the TE levels were detected between sexes in P. glauca and A. pelagicus; in all cases, the highest concentrations were found in female muscle tissue. The ability of sharks to bioaccumulate ETs depends of the metals (essentials higher than non-essential) but is explained mainly by feeding habits associated to sexes (population segregation) and size (ontogeny). The association between TE in shark specimens was related to the essentiality, their antagonistic action, and origin. The Se/Hg ratio was significantly higher than 1, evidence of the protective role of dietary Se against Hg uptake and toxicity in all specimens of the three shark species. Also, the elevate inverse correlation of As and Cd versus Se could indicate a protective action of Se against these toxic metals, but the mechanism must be investigated.
719	33420176	Metal concentrations in coastal sharks from The Bahamas with a focus on the Caribbean Reef shark.	Over the last century anthropogenic activities have rapidly increased the influx of metals and metalloids entering the marine environment, which can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in marine top consumers. This may elicit sublethal effects on target organisms, having broad implications for human seafood consumers. We provide the first assessment of metal (Cd, Pb, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Ag, and THg) and metalloid (As) concentrations in the muscle tissue of coastal sharks from The Bahamas. A total of 36 individual sharks from six species were evaluated, spanning two regions/study areas, with a focus on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), and to a lesser extent the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). This is due their high relative abundance and ecological significance throughout coastal Bahamian and regional ecosystems. Caribbean reef sharks exhibited some of the highest metal concentrations compared to five other species, and peaks in the concentrations of Pb, Cr, Cu were observed as individuals reached sexual maturity. Observations were attributed to foraging on larger, more piscivorous prey, high longevity, as well a potential slowing rate of growth. We observed correlations between some metals, which are challenging to interpret but may be attributed to trophic level and ambient metal conditions. Our results provide the first account of metal concentrations in Bahamian sharks, suggesting individuals exhibit high concentrations which may potentially cause sublethal effects. Finally, these findings underscore the potential toxicity of shark meat and have significant implications for human consumers.
720	33415764	The morphology and evolution of chondrichthyan cranial muscles: A digital dissection of the elephantfish Callorhinchus milii and the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula.	The anatomy of sharks, rays, and chimaeras (chondrichthyans) is crucial to understanding the evolution of the cranial system in vertebrates due to their position as the sister group to bony fishes (osteichthyans). Strikingly different arrangements of the head in the two constituent chondrichthyan groups-holocephalans and elasmobranchs-have played a pivotal role in the formation of evolutionary hypotheses targeting major cranial structures such as the jaws and pharynx. However, despite the advent of digital dissections as a means of easily visualizing and sharing the results of anatomical studies in three dimensions, information on the musculoskeletal systems of the chondrichthyan head remains largely limited to traditional accounts, many of which are at least a century old. Here, we use synchrotron tomographic data to carry out a digital dissection of a holocephalan and an elasmobranch widely used as model species: the elephantfish, Callorhinchus milii, and the small-spotted catshark, Scyliorhinus canicula. We describe and figure the skeletal anatomy of the head, labial, mandibular, hyoid, and branchial cartilages in both taxa as well as the muscles of the head and pharynx. In Callorhinchus, we make several new observations regarding the branchial musculature, revealing several previously unreported or ambiguously characterized muscles, likely homologous to their counterparts in the elasmobranch pharynx. We also identify a previously unreported structure linking the pharyngohyal of Callorhinchus to the neurocranium. Finally, we review what is known about the evolution of chondrichthyan cranial muscles from their fossil record and discuss the implications for muscle homology and evolution, broadly concluding that the holocephalan pharynx is likely derived from a more elasmobranch-like form which is plesiomorphic for the chondrichthyan crown group. This dataset has great potential as a resource, particularly for researchers using these model species for zoological research, functional morphologists requiring models of musculature and skeletons, as well as for palaeontologists seeking comparative models for extinct taxa.
721	33415661	Mercury in neonatal and juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Part I: exposure assessment.	Elasmobranchs are exposed to mercury (Hg) through a variety of pathways in the environment. This study assessed maternal offloading and diet-based Hg exposure for neonatal and juvenile blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) from Charlotte Harbor located along southwest Florida's coast, a recognized Hg hotspot. Neonates (n = 57) had highest total Hg (THg) concentrations in the kidney (0.56 ± 0.26 mg kg
723	33410929	Identification of distinct LRC- and Fc receptor complex-like chromosomal regions in fish supports that teleost leukocyte immune-type receptors are distant relatives of mammalian Fc receptor-like molecules.	Leukocyte immune-type receptors (LITRs) are a large family of immunoregulatory receptor-types originally identified in the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus (Ip)LITRs). Phylogenetic analyses of LITRs show that they share distant evolutionary relationships with important mammalian immunoregulatory receptors belonging to the Fc receptors family and the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC), but their syntenic relationships with these immunoglobulin superfamily members have not been investigated. To further examine the possible evolutionary connections between teleost LITRs and various mammalian immunoregulatory receptor-types, we surveyed the genomic databases of representative vertebrate taxa and our results show that teleost LITRs generally exist in large genomic clusters, which are linked to vangl2, arhgef11, and slam family genes, features that are also shared by amphibian and mammalian Fc receptor-like molecules (FCRLs). Moreover, detailed phylogenetic comparisons between the individual Ig-like domains of LITRs and mammalian FCRLs shows that these receptors share related Ig-like domains indicative of their common ancestry. However, contrary to our previous reports, no supportive evidence for phylogenetic relationships between the Ig-like domains of LITRs with the Ig-like domains of LRC-encoded mammalian immunoregulatory receptors was found. We also identified an LRC-like region in the zebrafish genome, but no expanded litr-related genes were located in this region. Similarly, no lilr-related genes were found in spotted gar, a representative basal ray-finned fish. Finally, two distantly related fcrls and an LRC-like gene were identified in the elephant shark genome, suggesting that the loss of an immunoregulatory receptor-containing LRC region may be unique to ray-finned fish.
724	33403689	Coastal sharks and rays in a marine protected area in southern Brazil.	In southern Brazil, we investigated shark and ray capture records in an integral protection marine protection area (MPA) that allows fishing in that area. We found 10 shark and nine ray species, of which 88.5% and 66.2%, respectively, are endangered. Female adults and neonates of both sexes are abundant in the area, with records of stranding of large specimens, postcapture abortions and ovigerous capsules with fresh embryos on the beach. We suggest the application of continuous fisheries monitoring and an increase in guidelines on the capture of endangered species.
725	33394123	The effects of elevated potassium, acidosis, reduced oxygen levels, and temperature on the functional properties of isolated myocardium from three elasmobranch fishes: clearnose skate (Rostroraja eglanteria), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), and sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus).	Elevated plasma potassium levels (hyperkalemia), reduced plasma pH (acidosis), reduced blood oxygen content, and elevated temperatures are associated with species-specific rates of at-vessel and post-release mortality in elasmobranch fishes. The mechanism linking these physiological disturbances to mortality remains undetermined however, and we hypothesize that the proximate cause is reduced myocardial function. We measured changes in the functional properties of isolated ventricular myocardial strips from clearnose skate (Rostroraja eglanteria), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), and sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) when subjected to the following stressors (both in isolation and in combination): hyperkalemia (7.4 mM K
726	33393266	[Characteristics of fish aggregation devices (FADs)and associated tuna schools behavior in Chinese tuna purse seine fishery.]	The use of fish aggregation devices (FADs) can increase catchability of tuna purse seine for associated tuna schools. In the past decades, large scale deployments of FADs have drawn the international attention due to their negative effects on the marine environment. Finding a FAD design ecologically and economically compatible has therefore become a challenge for tuna purse seine fishe-ry. Nowadays, knowledge and comprehension of interaction between FADs and catch species are quite lacking as a result of limited experimental investigation. We interviewed the captain of Chinese tuna purse seiner based on questionnaire to summarize the status of FADs deployment strategy, structural design, capture and ecological characteristics, and the behavior characteristics of associa-ted schools from the perspective of fishermen's knowledge and experience. We also quantified the cognitive differences of the investigated issues based on the index of consistency (IoC). Our results showed that: 1) the average number of year-round FADs deployment was (102±37) per vessel, and the number of that being lost was (72±1). 2) empirical knowledge from fishing masters indicated that man-made FADs could attract more tuna than natural floating objects (
727	33390359	Four new species of Acanthobothrium van Beneden, 1849 (Cestoda: Onchoproteocephalidea) from the spotted skate, Raja straeleni Poll, off the Western Cape, South Africa.	The examination of eight spotted skates, Raja straeleni Poll, resulted in the discovery of four new species of Acanthobothrium van Beneden, 1849, namely A. microhabentes sp. n., A. microtenuis sp. n., A. crassus sp. n., and A. dolichocollum sp. n., located off the Western Cape of South Africa. With a total of over 200 valid species of Acanthobothrium recognised worldwide, the use of an integrative approach becomes imperative in the interest of simplifying interspecific comparisons between congeners. In accordance with this, the four new species were incorporated into the category classification system established by Ghoshroy and Caira in 2001, where they were identified as category 2 species, which, at present, includes 47 recognised species of Acanthobothrium. Nevertheless, each of the four new species exhibits postovarian testes, a most intriguing and highly unusual feature among Acanthobothrium, instantly differentiating them from most congeners. This feature has been reported in 12 congeners, which have previously been considered to be restricted to waters of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Not only do the four new congeners represent the first species of Acanthobothrium reported from southern Africa, but they also represent the first reported species with postovarian testes from the southern Atlantic Ocean. Regarding the legitimacy of the four new species, only two other category 2 species are reported to exhibit this feature, namely A. popi Fyler, Caira et Jensen, 2009, and A. bobconniorum Fyler et Caira, 2010, to which the four congeners were compared to. Acanthobothrium microhabentes sp. n. is the smallest of the congeners and differs from A. popi and A. bobconniorum by having fewer testes and postovarian testes, a shorter body, fewer proglottids, a shorter scolex, and longer cephalic peduncle. Acanthobothrium microtenuis sp. n. differs from A. popi and A. bobconniorum by having fewer testes and postovarian testes, a shorter scolex, longer cephalic peduncle, and the possession of columnar spinitriches on the anterior region of the terminal proglottid. Acanthobothrium crassus sp.n. differs from A. popi and A. bobconniorum by having fewer postovarian testes, a narrower cirrus-sac, larger vitelline follicles, and a longer cephalic peduncle. Acanthobothrium dolichocollum sp. n. is the longest of the four new species and differs from A. popi and A. bobconniorum by having fewer postovarian testes, more postporal testes, a larger body, more proglottids, larger testes and vitelline follicles, and an exceptionally long cephalic peduncle. Apart from differences in overall size, the four new species differ in a combination of measurements for the scolex, vitelline follicles, muscular pad and cephalic peduncle, and the number of proglottids and testes. The four species were recovered from a previously unexplored host and locality, expanding the host associations and geographical distribution of the genus.
728	33384218	A refined method of en bloc open-door laminoplasty for resection of intradural spinal tumors in the thoracic and lumbar spine.	"BACKGROUND: The open-door laminoplasty has been used to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy. This technique has been applied to the surgical treatment of thoracic and lumbar spinal canal tumors instead of simple laminectomy or hemilaminectomy. However, previously reported laminoplasty methods did not keep posterior supporting elements intact such as the laminae and the spinous processes with supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, and almost all of them needed instruments for the fixation of reconstructed laminae. The purpose of this paper is to introduce our open-door laminoplasty method, which keep all posterior supporting elements intact and reconstruct the laminae without instrument.
METHODS: Eight patients (mean age 61 years) underwent en bloc open-door laminoplasty in the thoracic and lumbar spine for resection of intradural spinal tumors. Two grooves are made bilaterally on the laminae just medial side of the facet joints. One-half of each spinous process of the adjacent vertebrae above and below the laminoplasty is cracked diagonally to create a green stick fracture and bent to the hinged side for sufficient elevation of the laminar flap. After tumor resection, the laminar flap is restored to its original site, resulting in the complete preservation of the posterior supporting elements.
RESULTS: Operative exposure was good and permitted complete resection. No complications such as postoperative spinal canal stenosis or kyphosis were observed. Computed tomography(CT) indicated that bony fusion occurred in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The supraspinous and interspinous ligaments above and below laminoplasty were kept intact during surgery in our method. Therefore, the continuity of posterior supporting elements (laminae and spinous processes connected by supraspinous and interspinous ligaments) were completely preserved."
729	33383247	Overcoming multi-year impacts of maternal isotope signatures using multi-tracers and fast turnover tissues in juvenile sharks.	Stable isotopes are often used to determine the ecological role of different age classes of animals, but particularly for young animals this approach may be compromised. During gestation and or incubation body tissues of the young are derived directly from the mother. In neonates or post hatching, there is a period of transformation as the young grow and forage independently, but during this period different organs will continue to reflect the maternal isotopic signature as a function of their turnover rate. How long this maternal hangover persists remains poorly understood. We applied a multi-tracer approach (δ
730	33381902	Comparative genomic analysis of human GLI2 locus using slowly evolving fish revealed the ancestral gnathostome set of early developmental enhancers.	"BACKGROUND: The zinc finger-containing transcription factor Gli2, is a key mediator of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and participates in embryonic patterning of various organs including the central nervous system (CNS) and limbs. Abnormal expression of Gli2 can impede the transcription of Hh target genes through disruption of proper balance between Gli2 and Gli3 functions. Therefore, delineation of enhancers that are required for complementary roles of Glis would allow the interrogation of those pathogenic variants that cause gene dysregulation, and a corresponding abnormal phenotype. Previously, we reported tissue-specific enhancers for Gli family including Gli2 through direct tetrapod-teleost comparisons.
RESULTS: Here, we employed the sequence alignments of slowly evolving spotted gar and elephant shark and have identified six novel conserved noncoding elements in human GLI2 containing locus. Zebrafish-based transgenic assays revealed that combined action of these autonomous CNEs reflects many aspects of Gli2 specific endogenous transcriptional activity, including CNS and pectoral fins.
CONCLUSION: Taken together with our previous findings, this study suggests that Hh-signaling controlled deployment of Gli2 activity in embryonic patterning arose in the common ancestor of gnathostomes. These GLI2 specific cis-regulatory modules will help to identify DNA variants that probably reside outside of coding intervals and are associated with congenital anomalies."

A method for the determination of microplastic (MP) content in seafood is proposed based on the selective digestion of seafood without the degradation of MP.

732	33362953	Description of the microbiota in epidermal mucus and skin of sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum and Negaprion brevirostris) and one stingray (Hypanus americanus).	Skin mucus in fish is the first barrier between the organism and the environment but the role of skin mucus in protecting fish against pathogens is not well understood. During copulation in sharks, the male bites the female generating wounds, which are then highly likely to become infected by opportunistic bacteria from the water or from the male shark's mouth. Describing the microbial component of epithelial mucus may allow future understanding of this first line of defense in sharks. In this study, we analyzed mucus and skin samples obtained from 19 individuals of two shark species and a stingray: the nurse shark (

734	33355942	A reappraisal of the pectoral skeleton of lantern sharks (Elasmobranchii: Squaliformes: Etmopteridae).	The morphology of the articular region of the pectoral girdle and associated basals in Etmopteridae is revised in light of new evidence provided by taxa unavailable for previous studies. Such studies considered that etmopterids plesiomorphically had a single pectoral articular condyle, and only Etmopterus had two separate ones. Our reanalysis indicates that the possession of two separate condyles, one for the articulation of the propterygium and the second for the meso- and metapterygium, is the most widespread condition in this group. However, the presence of two separate articular condyles is not recovered as a synapomorphy for Etmopteridae. Previous studies also proposed that etmopterids lack a hook-like process on the anteroproximal margin of the anteriormost pectoral basal. We document that the hook-like process is plesiomorphically present in Etmopteridae, thus corroborating the hypothesis of closer relationships between this family and the other squaliforms that also share this process, namely Centrophoridae, Dalatiidae, Oxynotidae, and Somniosidae.
735	33353817	Post-arrest wide complex rhythm: What is the cause of death?	"A 72-year-old man presented to the ED following witnessed cardiac arrest. After return of spontaneous circulation, an ECG was performed which demonstrated a wide complex rhythm with ""shark fin"" morphology. With careful examination it is possible to identify the J point and determine that the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings actually represent massive ST-elevation indicative of occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). Initial troponin was undetectable. The patient underwent emergent cardiac catheterization and had a 100% proximal LAD occlusion that was successfully stented. The patient was discharged home neurologically intact several days later. This case highlights the importance of careful ECG interpretation and the limitations of troponin assays in the evaluation of acute coronary syndrome. Most importantly, we demonstrate how to evaluate for ST elevation in the context of a widened QRS complex."
736	33351950	A NEW SPECIES OF ACANTHOBOTHRIUM (CESTODA: ONCHOPROTEOCEPHALIDEA) FROM THE SMALLEYE PYGMY SHARK, SQUALIOLUS ALIAE (CHONDRICHTHYES: SQUALIFORMES: DALATIIDAE), FROM TAIWAN.	The cestode fauna of Squaliolus aliae was examined for the first time following the collection of elasmobranch specimens from Taiwan in 2005, 2013, and 2017. This small shark was found to host 2 tapeworm species. These consist of Acanthobothrium katherineae n. sp., which is new to science and is described herein, and a second species, in the genus Scyphophyllidium, which also appears to be new, but which is represented by insufficient material for formal description. Acanthobothrium katherineae is a category 5 species. It can be distinguished from 5 of the 19 other category 5 species in that it is apolytic, retaining proglottids on its strobila until they are gravid. This new species differs from the remaining 14 category 5 species in its combination of the following features: It is a smaller worm, has fewer than 100 proglottids, has a relatively short cephalic peduncle, and differs in bothridial size and loculus ratio. Sequence data for the D1-D3 region of the 28S rDNA gene were generated for one specimen of A. katherineae. This sequence, along with comparable sequence data for adults of 14 described and 2 undescribed species as well as specimens of 6 undescribed larval members of the genus, was included in a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis. The resulting tree places the shark-hosted A. katherineae within a clade of stingray-hosted species, with Acanthobothrium romanowi as its sister taxon. Acanthobothrium katherineae is 1 of only 19 Acanthobothrium species known to parasitize sharks. The tree resulting from this study, which is preliminary given the relatively poor taxon sampling of the diversity in the genus, included 3 of the shark-parasitizing Acanthobothrium species and suggests that all 3 represent host-switching events. This is the first report of an Acanthobothrium species from the family Dalatiidae and the first report of a Scyphophyllidium species from the order Squaliformes. These findings suggest that other members of the Squaliformes, many of which have not previously been examined for parasites, may host additional novel cestode taxa.

741	33332427	Repeatability of baited remote underwater video station (BRUVS) results within and between seasons.	Baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) are increasingly being used to evaluate and monitor reef communities. Many BRUVS studies compare multiple sites sampled at single time points that may differ from the sampling time of another site. As BRUVS use grows in its application to provide data relevant to sustainable management, marine protected area success, and overall reef health, understanding repeatability of sampling results is vital. We examined the repeatability of BRUVS results for the elasmobranch community both within and between seasons and years, and explored environmental factors affecting abundances at two sites in Indonesia. On 956 BRUVS, 1139 elasmobranchs (69% rays, 31% sharks) were observed. We found consistent results in species composition and abundances within a season and across years. However, elasmobranch abundances were significantly higher in the wet season. The elasmobranch community was significantly different between the two sites sampled, one site being more coastal and easily accessed by fishermen. Our results demonstrate that while BRUVS are a reliable and repeatable method for surveying elasmobranchs, care must be taken in the timing of sampling between different regions to ensure that any differences observed are due to inherent differences amongst sampling areas as opposed to seasonal dissimilarities.
742	33329708	Mineralization of the Callorhinchus Vertebral Column (Holocephali; Chondrichthyes).	Members of the Chondrichthyes (Elasmobranchii and Holocephali) are distinguished by their largely cartilaginous endoskeletons, which comprise an uncalcified core overlain by a mineralized layer; in the Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates, rays) most of this mineralization takes the form of calcified polygonal tiles known as tesserae. In recent years, these skeletal tissues have been described in ever increasing detail in sharks and rays, but those of Holocephali (chimaeroids) have been less well-studied, with conflicting accounts as to whether or not tesserae are present. During embryonic ontogeny in holocephalans, cervical vertebrae fuse to form a structure called the synarcual. The synarcual mineralizes early and progressively, anteroposteriorly and dorsoventrally, and therefore presents a good skeletal structure in which to observe mineralized tissues in this group. Here, we describe the development and mineralization of the synarcual in an adult and stage 36 elephant shark embryo (
743	33325101	The 'classic stromatolite' Cryptozoön is a keratose sponge-microbial consortium.	Animal evolution transformed microbial mat development. Canonically inferred negative effects include grazing, disturbance and competition for space. In contrast, ancient examples of cooperation between microbial mats and invertebrates have rarely been reported. Late Cambrian (~485 million years) Cryptozoön is widely regarded as the first stromatolite to have received a taxonomic name and has been compared with present-day examples at Shark Bay, Australia. Here, we show that Cryptozoön is an interlayered consortium of keratose ('horny') sponge and microbial carbonate in roughly equal proportions. Cryptozoön's well-defined layering reflects repeated alternation of sponge and microbial mat. Its distinctive lateral growth is due to the ability of keratosans to colonize steep and overhanging surfaces. Contrary to the perception of Phanerozoic stromatolites as anachronistic survivors in a eukaryotic world, Cryptozoön suggests mutualistic behaviour in which sponges and microbial mats cooperated to gain support, stability and relief, while sharing substrates, bacteria and metabolites. Keratosan-microbial consortia may have been mistaken for stromatolites throughout the record of the past 500 million years, and possibly longer.
744	33324393	Specific Targeting of Lymphoma Cells Using Semisynthetic Anti-Idiotype Shark Antibodies.	The B-cell receptor (BCR) is a key player of the adaptive immune system. It is a unique part of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules expressed on the surface of B cells. In case of many B-cell lymphomas, the tumor cells express a tumor-specific and functionally active BCR, also known as idiotype. Utilizing the idiotype as target for lymphoma therapy has emerged to be demanding since the idiotype differs from patient to patient. Previous studies have shown that shark-derived antibody domains (vNARs) isolated from a semi-synthetic CDR3-randomized library allow for the rapid generation of anti-idiotype binders. In this study, we evaluated the potential of generating patient-specific binders against the idiotype of lymphomas. To this end, the BCRs of three different lymphoma cell lines SUP-B8, Daudi, and IM-9 were identified, the variable domains were reformatted and the resulting monoclonal antibodies produced. The SUP-B8 BCR served as antigen in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based screening of the yeast-displayed vNAR libraries which resulted after three rounds of screening in the enrichment of antigen-binding vNARs. Five vNARs were expressed as Fc fusion proteins and consequently analyzed for their binding to soluble antigen using biolayer interferometry (BLI) revealing binding constants in the lower single-digit nanomolar range. These variants showed specific binding to the parental SUP-B8 cell line confirming a similar folding of the recombinantly expressed proteins compared with the native cell surface-presented BCR. First initial experiments to utilize the generated vNAR-Fc variants for BCR-clustering to induce apoptosis or ADCC/ADCP did not result in a significant decrease of cell viability. Here, we report an alternative approach for a personalized B-cell lymphoma therapy based on the construction of vNAR-Fc antibody-drug conjugates to enable specific killing of malignant B cells, which may widen the therapeutic window for B-cell lymphoma therapy.
745	33324175	Multimodal Imaging and Analysis of the Neuroanatomical Organization of the Primary Olfactory Inputs in the Brownbanded Bamboo Shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum.	There is currently a limited understanding of the morphological and functional organization of the olfactory system in cartilaginous fishes, particularly when compared to bony fishes and terrestrial vertebrates. In this fish group, there is a clear paucity of information on the characterization, density, and distribution of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) within the sensory olfactory epithelium lining the paired olfactory rosettes, and their functional implications with respect to the hydrodynamics of incurrent water flow into the nares. This imaging study examines the brownbanded bamboo shark

Movement ecology has traditionally focused on the movements of animals over large time scales, but, with advancements in sensor technology, the focus can become increasingly fine scale. Accelerometers are commonly applied to quantify animal behaviours and can elucidate fine-scale (<2 s) behaviours. Machine learning methods are commonly applied to animal accelerometry data; however, they require the trial of multiple methods to find an ideal solution. We used tri-axial accelerometers (10 Hz) to quantify four behaviours in Port Jackson sharks (

Microbial mat communities possess extensive taxonomic and functional diversity, which drive high metabolic rates and rapid cycling of major elements. Modern microbial mats occurring in hypersaline environments are considered as analogs to extinct geobiological formations dating back to ∼ 3.5 Gyr ago. Despite efforts to understand the diversity and metabolic potential of hypersaline microbial mats in Shark Bay, Western Australia, there has yet to be molecular analyses at the transcriptional level in these microbial communities. In this study, we generated metatranscriptomes for the first time from actively growing mats comparing the type of mat, as well as the influence of diel and seasonal cycles. We observed that the overall gene transcription is strongly influenced by microbial community structure and seasonality. The most transcribed genes were associated with tackling the low nutrient conditions by the uptake of fatty acids, phosphorus, iron, and nickel from the environment as well as with protective mechanisms against elevated salinity conditions and to prevent build-up of ammonium produced by nitrate reducing microorganisms. A range of pathways involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles were identified in mat metatranscriptomes, with anoxygenic photosynthesis and chemoautotrophy using the Arnon-Buchanan cycle inferred as major pathways involved in the carbon cycle. Furthermore, enrichment of active anaerobic pathways (e.g., sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, Wood-Ljungdahl) in smooth mats corroborates previous metagenomic studies and further advocates the potential of these communities as modern analogs of ancient microbialites.
752	33307506	The consumption of shark meat in the Amazon region and its implications for human health and the marine ecosystem.	Here, we evaluated the levels of As, Hg, Pb, and Cd in shark meat sold along the Amazon Coast of Brazil and used nitrogen stable isotope values to determine trophic position and to assess element biomagnification. From market samples, a total of 13 species were identified via molecular analysis, including those listed as endangered and vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Arsenic was present in significantly higher concentrations than all other elements, followed by Hg, with the highest mean concentrations recorded in M. higmani (As: 19.46 ± 8.79 μg/g ww) and C. acronotus (Hg: 1.12 ± 0.68 μg/g ww). Lead and Cd were recorded at much lower levels in all species. The EWI of individual elements were above PTWI for all species when considering Hg, seven species for inorganic arsenic (iAs), and one species for Pb. The weekly consumption of 10 species should be reduced to less than 416.39 g, which is equivalent to the daily estimated fish consumption rate in the region. The mean (±SD) δ
753	33304587	Gill slits provide a window into the respiratory physiology of sharks.	Metabolically important traits, such as gill surface area and metabolic rate, underpin life histories, population dynamics and extinction risk, as they govern the availability of energy for growth, survival and reproduction. Estimating both gill surface area and metabolic rate can be challenging, especially when working with large-bodied, threatened species. Ideally, these traits, and respiratory physiology in general, could be inferred from external morphology using a faster, non-lethal method. Gill slit height is quick to measure on live organisms and is anatomically connected to the gill arch. Here, we relate gill slit height and gill surface area for five Carcharhiniform sharks. We compared both total and parabranchial gill surface area to mean and individual gill slit height in physical specimens. We also compared empirical measurements of relative gill slit height (i.e. in proportion to total length) to those estimated from field guide illustrations to examine the potential of using anatomical drawings to measure gill slit height. We find strong positive relationships between gill slit height and gill surface area at two scales: (i) for total gill surface area and mean gill slit height across species and (ii) for parabranchial gill surface area and individual gill slit height within and across species. We also find that gill slit height is a consistent proportion of the fork length of physical specimens. Consequently, relative gill slit height measured from field guide illustrations proved to be surprisingly comparable to those measured from physical specimens. While the generality of our findings needs to be evaluated across a wider range of taxonomy and ecological lifestyles, they offer the opportunity that we might only need to go to the library and measure field guide illustrations to yield a non-lethal, first-order approximation of the respiratory physiology of sharks.

Focusing on 27 rare filter-feeding megamouth sharks (Megachasma pelagios) captured as a by-catch of drift gillnet fishery in the Pacific Ocean to the east of Taiwan, this study analyzes the concentrations of 24 elements in their muscle, discusses the bioaccumulation of each element and the correlation between different elements, and assesses the potential health risks of consuming megamouth shark muscle. Among the 24 elements, mean concentrations of Ga, Ag, Li, Bi, Hg, Co, and Cd were relatively low ranging from 10
755	33301759	Molecular characterization of kisspeptin receptors and gene expression analysis during oogenesis in the Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii).	Sturgeons belong to a subclass of fishes that derived from ray-finned fish ancestors preceding the emergence of teleosts. The Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii) is a late-maturing fish with the females reaching puberty under aquaculture conditions at 6-10 years of age. Since kisspeptin has been shown to be a key hormone involved in regulation of major reproductive processes of many vertebrate species, this study was conducted to better understand the kisspeptin receptor (KissR) in sturgeon. In this study we have cloned Russian sturgeon KissR1 from brain mRNA and observed the ontogeny of rsKissR1 mRNA expression in ovarian follicles. Multiple sequence alignment of KissR1, KissR4, and their orthologs revealed that the Russian sturgeon (rs) KissR1 sequence shares 64%-77% identity with elephant shark, coelacanth, and gar and 44-58% identity with tetrapod and teleost KissR1 sequences, while KissR4 seemed to share <65% identity to eel KissR2 and ~57% identity to Perciformes and Cypriniformes. Further rsKissR4 showed <97% identity to reed fish KissR4, <63% with Squamata (Reptiles) and gar KissR4. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that rsKissR1 is more closely related to coelacanth and gar KissR1 than teleost, while rsKissR4 was part of the KissR4 clade and shared higher similarity with Actinopterygiian sequences. We have further predicted homology models for both rsKiss receptors and performed in-silico analyses of their binding to a kiss-10 peptide. Both sturgeon and zebrafish Kiss1 and Kiss2 activated rsKissR1 via both PKC/Ca2+ and PKA/cAMP signal-transduction pathways, while rsKissR2 was found to be less effective and was not activated by stKiss peptides. Ovarian rsKissR transcript levels for 10 fishes were determined by real-time PCR and significantly increased concomitantly with oogenesis, where the highest level of expression was evident in black follicles. These data suggest that extra-neuronal expression of the kisspeptin receptor may be involved in sturgeon reproduction in a manner dependent on reproductive development.

Understanding health and mortality in killer whales (Orcinus orca) is crucial for management and conservation actions. We reviewed pathology reports from 53 animals that stranded in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaii between 2004 and 2013 and used data from 35 animals that stranded from 2001 to 2017 to assess association with morphometrics, blubber thickness, body condition and cause of death. Of the 53 cases, cause of death was determined for 22 (42%) and nine additional animals demonstrated findings of significant importance for population health. Causes of calf mortalities included infectious disease, nutritional, and congenital malformations. Mortalities in sub-adults were due to trauma, malnutrition, and infectious disease and in adults due to bacterial infections, emaciation and blunt force trauma. Death related to human interaction was found in every age class. Important incidental findings included concurrent sarcocystosis and toxoplasmosis, uterine leiomyoma, vertebral periosteal proliferations, cookiecutter shark (Isistius sp.) bite wounds, excessive tooth wear and an ingested fish hook. Blubber thickness increased significantly with body length (all p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no relationship between body length and an index of body condition (BCI). BCI was higher in animals that died from trauma. This study establishes a baseline for understanding health, nutritional status and causes of mortality in stranded killer whales. Given the evidence of direct human interactions on all age classes, in order to be most successful recovery efforts should address the threat of human interactions, especially for small endangered groups of killer whales that occur in close proximity to large human populations, interact with recreational and commercial fishers and transit established shipping lanes.
760	33264078	Transforming nanobodies into high-precision tools for protein function analysis.	Single-domain antibodies, derived from camelid heavy antibodies (nanobodies) or shark variable new antigen receptors, have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their extremely versatile nature and the opportunities they offer for downstream modification. Discovered more than three decades ago, these 120-amino acid (∼15-kDa) antibody fragments are known to bind their target with high specificity and affinity. Key features of nanobodies that make them very attractive include their single-domain nature, small size, and affordable high-level expression in prokaryotes, and their cDNAs are routinely obtained in the process of their isolation. This facilitates and stimulates new experimental approaches. Hence, it allows researchers to formulate new answers to complex biomedical questions. Through elementary PCR-based technologies and chemical modification strategies, their primary structure can be altered almost at leisure while retaining their specificity and biological activity, transforming them into highly tailored tools that meet the increasing demands of current-day biomedical research. In this review, various aspects of camelid nanobodies are expounded, including intracellular delivery in recombinant format for manipulation of, i.e., cytoplasmic targets, their derivatization to improve nanobody orientation as a capturing device, approaches to reversibly bind their target, their potential as protein-silencing devices in cells, the development of strategies to transfer nanobodies through the blood-brain barrier and their application in CAR-T experimentation. We also discuss some of their disadvantages and conclude with future prospects.
761	33262401	Fossil microbial shark tooth decay documents in situ metabolism of enameloid proteins as nutrition source in deep water environments.	Alteration of organic remains during the transition from the bio- to lithosphere is affected strongly by biotic processes of microbes influencing the potential of dead matter to become fossilized or vanish ultimately. If fossilized, bones, cartilage, and tooth dentine often display traces of bioerosion caused by destructive microbes. The causal agents, however, usually remain ambiguous. Here we present a new type of tissue alteration in fossil deep-sea shark teeth with in situ preservation of the responsible organisms embedded in a delicate filmy substance identified as extrapolymeric matter. The invading microorganisms are arranged in nest- or chain-like patterns between fluorapatite bundles of the superficial enameloid. Chemical analysis of the bacteriomorph structures indicates replacement by a phyllosilicate, which enabled in situ preservation. Our results imply that bacteria invaded the hypermineralized tissue for harvesting intra-crystalline bound organic matter, which provided nutrient supply in a nutrient depleted deep-marine environment they inhabited. We document here for the first time in situ bacteria preservation in tooth enameloid, one of the hardest mineralized tissues developed by animals. This unambiguously verifies that microbes also colonize highly mineralized dental capping tissues with only minor organic content when nutrients are scarce as in deep-marine environments.
762	33254649	Benefit-risk associated with the consumption of fish bycatch from tropical tuna fisheries.	Mercury, omega-3 (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) and macronutrients (fat and proteins) were quantified on a wet weight (ww) basis in 20 species of fish taken as bycatch in tropical tuna fisheries. Based on a hazard quotient taking into account mercury and omega-3 contents, a benefit-risk assessment for the consumption of these pelagic species was conducted for three people categories: young children, children and adults. All fish bycatch were found to be an excellent source of proteins (min‒max = 14.4-25.2 g/100 g fillet), had low omega-6/omega-3 ratios (<1, except for silky shark), and had mercury content below the safety limits defined by sanitary agencies. Silky shark and Istiophoridae had the highest mercury contents (min‒max = 0.029-0.317 ppm ww). Omega-3 contents were the lowest in silky shark (0.2 ± 0.2 mg/100 g fillet) and the highest in striped marlin (3.6 ± 3.2 g/100 g fillet). Billfishes (Istiophoridae, including striped marlin), minor tunas (Scombridae), and Carangidae had the highest omega-3 contents (min‒max = 0.68-7.28 g/100 g fillet). The highest hazard quotient values obtained for silky shark and great barracuda reflected a lower nutritional benefit (i.e., low omega-3 source) than risk (i.e., mercury exposure), making them not advisable for consumption. Eight species had low hazard quotients, and among them cottonmouth jack and flat needlefish were found of high health interest (high protein, moderate fat contents, and low omega-6/omega-3 ratio). A daily serving portion of 85-200 g (according to people category) can be recommended for these species. Batfish, and to a lower extent pompano dolphinfish and brassy chub, can also be consumed safely and would provide greater health benefits than risks. These results advocate for a better access of these species to local populations.

764	33251490	The White-Spotted Bamboo Shark Genome Reveals Chromosome Rearrangements and Fast-Evolving Immune Genes of Cartilaginous Fish.	Chondrichthyan (cartilaginous fish) occupies a key phylogenetic position and is important for investigating evolutionary processes of vertebrates. However, limited whole genomes impede our in-depth knowledge of important issues such as chromosome evolution and immunity. Here, we report the chromosome-level genome of white-spotted bamboo shark. Combing it with other shark genomes, we reconstructed 16 ancestral chromosomes of bamboo shark and illustrate a dynamic chromosome rearrangement process. We found that genes on 13 fast-evolving chromosomes can be enriched in immune-related pathways. And two chromosomes contain important genes that can be used to develop single-chain antibodies, which were shown to have high affinity to human disease markers by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also found three bone formation-related genes were lost due to chromosome rearrangements. Our study highlights the importance of chromosome rearrangements, providing resources for understanding of cartilaginous fish diversification and potential application of single-chain antibodies.
765	33251210	New Amphiphilic Squalene Derivative Improves Metabolism of Adipocytes Differentiated From Diabetic Adipose-Derived Stem Cells and Prevents Excessive Lipogenesis.	Squalene (Sq) is a natural compound, found in various plant oils, algae, and larger quantity in deep-sea shark liver. It is also known as an intermediate of cholesterol synthesis in plants and animals including humans. Although evidences demonstrated its antioxidant, anticancer, hypolipidemic, and hepatoprotective and cardioprotective effects, its biological effects in cellular function might have been underestimated because of the water-insoluble property. To overcome this hydrophobicity, we synthesized new amphiphilic Sq derivative (HH-Sq). On the other hand, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a valuable source in regenerative medicine for its ease of accessibility and multilineage differentiation potential. Nevertheless, impaired cellular functions of ASCs derived from diabetic donor have still been debated controversially. In this study, we explored the effect of the HH-Sq in comparison to Sq on the adipocyte differentiation of ASCs obtained from subjects with type 2 diabetes. Gene expression profile by microarray analysis at 14 days of adipogenic differentiation revealed that HH-Sq induced more genes involved in intracellular signaling processes, whereas Sq activated more transmembrane receptor pathway-related genes. In addition, more important number of down-regulated and up-regulated genes by Sq and HH-Sq were not overlapped, suggesting the compounds might not only have difference in their chemical property but also potentially exert different biological effects. Both Sq and HH-Sq improved metabolism of adipocytes by enhancing genes associated with energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity,

767	33237911	The megamouth shark, Megachasma pelagios, is not a luminous species.	Despite its five meters length, the megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios Taylor, Compagno & Struhsaker, 1983) is one of the rarest big sharks known in the world (117 specimens observed and documented so far). This filter-feeding shark has been assumed to be a luminous species, using its species-specific white band to produce bioluminescence as a lure trap. Another hypothesis was the use of the white band reflectivity to attract prey or for social recognition purposes. However, no histological study has ever been performed to confirm these assumptions so far. Two hypotheses about the megamouth shark's luminescence arose: firstly, the light emission may be intrinsically or extrinsically produced by specific light organs (photophores) located either on the upper jaw white band or inside the mouth; secondly, the luminous appearance might be a consequence of the reflection of prey luminescence on the white band during feeding events. Aims of the study were to test these hypotheses by highlighting the potential presence of specific photophores responsible for bioluminescence and to reveal and analyze the presence of specialized light-reflective structures in and around the mouth of the shark. By using different histological approaches (histological sections, fluorescent in situ hybridization, scanning electron microscopy) and spectrophotometry, this study allows to unravel these hypotheses and strongly supports that the megamouth shark does not emit bioluminescence, but might rather reflect the light produced by bioluminescent planktonic preys, thanks to the denticles of the white band.
768	33235202	Shape-preserving erosion controlled by the graded microarchitecture of shark tooth enameloid.	The teeth of all vertebrates predominantly comprise the same materials, but their lifespans vary widely: in stark contrast to mammals, shark teeth are functional only for weeks, rather than decades, making lifelong durability largely irrelevant. However, their diets are diverse and often mechanically demanding, and as such, their teeth should maintain a functional morphology, even in the face of extremely high and potentially damaging contact stresses. Here, we reconcile the dilemma between the need for an operative tooth geometry and the unavoidable damage inherent to feeding on hard foods, demonstrating that the tooth cusps of Port Jackson sharks, hard-shelled prey specialists, possess unusual microarchitecture that controls tooth erosion in a way that maintains functional cusp shape. The graded architecture in the enameloid provokes a location-specific damage response, combining chipping of outer enameloid and smooth wear of inner enameloid to preserve an efficient shape for grasping hard prey. Our discovery provides experimental support for the dominant theory that multi-layered tooth enameloid facilitated evolutionary diversification of shark ecologies.

772	33227806	Ontogenetic Shifts in Brain Size and Brain Organization of the Atlantic Sharpnose Shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae.	Throughout an animal's life, species may occupy different environments and exhibit distinct life stages, known as ontogenetic shifts. The life histories of most sharks (class: Chondrichthyes) are characterized by these ontogenetic shifts, which can be defined by changes in habitat and diet as well as behavioral changes at the onset of sexual maturity. In addition, fishes experience indeterminate growth, whereby the brain and body grow throughout the organism's life. Despite a presupposed lifelong neurogenesis in sharks, very little work has been done on ontogenetic changes in the brain, which may be informative about functional shifts in sensory and behavioral specializations. This study quantified changes in brain-body scaling and the scaling of six major brain regions (olfactory bulbs, telencephalon, diencephalon, optic tectum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata) throughout ontogeny in the Atlantic sharpnose shark, Rhizoprio-nodon terraenovae. As documented in other fishes, brain size increased significantly with body mass throughout ontogeny in this species, with the steepest period of growth in early life. The telencephalon, diencephalon, optic tectum, and medulla oblongata scaled with negative allometry against the rest of the brain throughout ontogeny. However, notably, the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum scaled hyperallometrically to the rest of the brain, whereby these structures enlarged disproportionately as this species matured. Changes in the relative size of the olfactory bulbs throughout ontogeny may reflect an increased reliance on olfaction at later life history stages in R. terraenovae, while changes in the relative size of the cerebellum throughout ontogeny may be indicative of the ability to capture faster prey or an increase in migratory nature as this species moves to offshore habitats, associated with the onset of sexual maturity.
773	33222156	Diet, trophic interactions and possible ecological role of commercial sharks and batoids in northern Peruvian waters.	The Peruvian sea represents one of the most productive ocean ecosystems and possesses one of the largest elasmobranch fisheries in the Pacific Ocean. Ecosystem-based management of these fisheries will require information on the trophic ecology of elasmobranchs. This study aimed to understand the diet, trophic interactions and the role of nine commercial elasmobranch species in northern Peru through the analysis of stomach contents. A total of 865 non-empty stomachs were analysed. Off northern Peru, elasmobranchs function as upper-trophic-level species consuming 78 prey items, predominantly teleosts and cephalopods. Two distinctive trophic assemblages were identified: (a) sharks (smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena, thresher shark Alopias spp. and blue shark Prionace glauca) that feed mainly on cephalopods in the pelagic ecosystem; and (b) sharks and batoids (Chilean eagle ray Myliobatis chilensis, humpback smooth-hound Mustelus whitneyi, spotted houndshark Triakis maculata, Pacific guitarfish Pseudobatos planiceps, copper shark Carcharhinus brachyurus and school shark Galeorhinus galeus) that feed mainly on teleosts and invertebrates in the benthonic and pelagic coastal ecosystem. This study reveals for the first time the diet of T. maculata and the importance of elasmobranchs as predators of abundant and commercial species (i.e., jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas and Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens). The results of this study can assist in the design of an ecosystem-based management for the northern Peruvian sea and the conservation of these highly exploited, threatened or poorly understood group of predators in one of the most productive marine ecosystems.
774	33221390	3D microstructural study of selachimorph enameloid evolution.	Enameloid, the hyper-mineralized tissue covering shark teeth is a complex structure resulting from both ameloblast and odontoblast activity. The way these two types of cells interact to set up this tissue is not fully understood and results in the formation of subunits in the enameloid: the Single Crystallite Enameloid (SCE) and the Bundled Crystallite Enameloid (BCE). Using the Focused Ion Beam Nanotomography (FIB-nt), 3D images were produced to assess the relationship between the SCE and BCE of one fossil and one recent neoselachian shark teeth. 3D analysis of crystallite bundles reveals a strong connection between the crystallites forming the SCE and those forming the bundles of the Radial Bundle Enameloid (RBE), a component of the BCE, although it has been suggested that SCE and BCE have a different origin: epithelial for the SCE and mesenchymal for the BCE. Another significant result of the use of FIB-nt is the visualization of frequent branching among the radial bundles forming the RBE, including horizontal link between adjacent bundles. FIB-nt demonstrates therefore a strong potential to decipher the complex evolution of hyper-mineralised tissue in shark teeth, and, therefore, to better understand the evolution of tooth structure among basal Gnathostomes.

Harness-type live bait rigs are commonly used for small baitfish; some anglers use such devices with small sharks when targeting large sharks and bony fish. Biofouling on the apparatus and the extent of the injuries indicated the material had likely been on the shark for several years. This case highlights the dangers of using these types of devices on juveniles of long-lived species that attain a large body size.

778	33206373	Regulate or tolerate: Thermal strategy of a coral reef flat resident, the epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum.	Highly variable thermal environments, such as coral reef flats, are challenging for marine ectotherms and are thought to invoke the use of behavioural strategies to avoid extreme temperatures and seek out thermal environments close to their preferred temperatures. Common to coral reef flats, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) possesses physiological adaptations to hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, such as those experienced on reef flats, but little is known regarding the thermal strategies used by these sharks. We investigated whether H. ocellatum uses behavioural thermoregulation (i.e., movement to occupy thermally favourable microhabitats) or tolerates the broad range of temperatures experienced on the reef flat. Using an automated shuttlebox system, we determined the preferred temperature of H. ocellatum under controlled laboratory conditions and then compared this preferred temperature to 6 months of in situ environmental and body temperatures of individual H. ocellatum across the Heron Island reef flat. The preferred temperature of H. ocellatum under controlled conditions was 20.7 ± 1.5°C, but the body temperatures of individual H. ocellatum on the Heron Island reef flat mirrored environmental temperatures regardless of season or month. Despite substantial temporal variation in temperature on the Heron Island reef flat (15-34°C during 2017), there was a lack of spatial variation in temperature across the reef flat between sites or microhabitats. This limited spatial variation in temperature creates a low-quality thermal habitat limiting the ability of H. ocellatum to behaviourally thermoregulate. Behavioural thermoregulation is assumed in many shark species, but it appears that H. ocellatum may utilize other physiological strategies to cope with extreme temperature fluctuations on coral reef flats. While H. ocellatum appears to be able to tolerate acute exposure to temperatures well outside of their preferred temperature, it is unclear how this, and other, species will cope as temperatures continue to rise and approach their critical thermal limits. Understanding how species will respond to continued warming and the strategies they may use will be key to predicting future populations and assemblages.
779	33204458	Centre-of-mass and minimal speed limits of the great hammerhead.	The great hammerhead is denser than water, and hence relies on hydrodynamic lift to compensate for its lack of buoyancy, and on hydrodynamic moment to compensate for a possible misalignment between centres of mass and buoyancy. Because hydrodynamic forces scale with the swimming speed squared, whereas buoyancy and gravity are independent of it, there is a critical speed below which the shark cannot generate enough lift to counteract gravity, and there are anterior and posterior centre-of-mass limits beyond which the shark cannot generate enough pitching moment to counteract the buoyancy-gravity couple. The speed and centre-of-mass limits were found from numerous wind-tunnel experiments on a scaled model of the shark. In particular, it was shown that the margin between the anterior and posterior centre-of-mass limits is a few tenths of the product between the length of the shark and the ratio between its weight in and out of water; a diminutive 1% body length. The paper presents the wind-tunnel experiments, and discusses the roles that the cephalofoil and the pectoral and caudal fins play in longitudinal balance of a shark.
780	33203942	A symmoriiform from the Late Devonian of Morocco demonstrates a derived jaw function in ancient chondrichthyans.	The Palaeozoic record of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, chimaeras, extinct relatives) and thus our knowledge of their anatomy and functional morphology is poor because of their predominantly cartilaginous skeletons. Here, we report a previously undescribed symmoriiform shark, Ferromirum oukherbouchi, from the Late Devonian of the Anti-Atlas. Computed tomography scanning reveals the undeformed shape of the jaws and hyoid arch, which are of a kind often used to represent primitive conditions for jawed vertebrates. Of critical importance, these closely fitting cartilages preclude the repeatedly hypothesized presence of a complete gill between mandibular and hyoid arches. We show that the jaw articulation is specialized and drives mandibular rotation outward when the mouth opens, and inward upon closure. The resultant eversion and inversion of the lower dentition presents a greater number of teeth to prey through the bite-cycle. This suggests an increased functional and ecomorphological disparity among chondrichthyans preceding and surviving the end-Devonian extinctions.
781	33199809	The power struggle: assessing interacting global change stressors via experimental studies on sharks.	Ocean warming and acidification act concurrently on marine ectotherms with the potential for detrimental, synergistic effects; yet, effects of these stressors remain understudied in large predatory fishes, including sharks. We tested for behavioural and physiological responses of blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) neonates to climate change relevant changes in temperature (28 and 31 °C) and carbon dioxide partial pressures (pCO

Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to environmental contamination, especially pollutants that may bioaccumulate and biomagnify, throughout the trophic web, such as metals. However, Elasmobranch management and conservation plans are challenging, and this group is often neglected regarding ecotoxicological analyses, particularly concerning metal detoxification mechanisms. This article discusses metallothionein (MT) mediated metal detoxification in Elasmobranchs and reflects on the current knowledge gap in this regard.
785	33189779	Conserved keratin gene clusters in ancient fish: An evolutionary seed for terrestrial adaptation.	Type I and type II keratins are subgroups of intermediate filament proteins that provide toughness to the epidermis and protect it from water loss. In terrestrial vertebrates, the keratin genes form two major clusters, clusters 1 and 2, each of which is dominated by type I and II keratin genes. By contrast, such clusters are not observed in teleost fish. Although the diversification of keratins is believed to have made a substantial contribution to terrestrial adaptation, its evolutionary process has not been clarified. Here, we performed a comprehensive genomic survey of the keratin genes of a broad range of vertebrates. As a result, we found that ancient fish lineages such as elephant shark, reedfish, spotted gar, and coelacanth share both keratin gene clusters. We also discovered an expansion of keratin genes that form a novel subcluster in reedfish. Syntenic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that two pairs of krt18/krt8 keratin genes were shared among all vertebrates, thus implying that they encode ancestral type I and II keratin protein sets. We further revealed that distinct keratin gene subclusters, which show specific expressions in the epidermis of adult amphibians, stemmed from canonical keratin genes in non-terrestrial ancestors. Molecular evolutionary analyses suggested that the selective constraints were relaxed in the adult epidermal subclusters of amphibians as well as the novel subcluster of reedfish. The results of the present study represent the process of diversification of keratins through a series of gene duplications that could have facilitated the terrestrial adaptation of vertebrates.
786	33186094	Erection of Euterranova n. gen. and Neoterranova n. gen. (Nematoda, Anisakidae), with the description of E. dentiduplicata n. sp. and new records of two other anisakid nematodes from sharks off New Caledonia.	Helminthological examinations of three species of sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, Triaenodon obesus (both Carcharhinidae, Carcharhiniformes) and Stegostoma fasciatum (Stegostomatidae, Orectolobiformes) from New Caledonian waters, carried out during 2003-2005, revealed the presence of three species of adult anisakid nematodes referable to Terranova Leiper et Atkinson, 1914. However, this genus can no longer be considered valid, because its type species has been designated a species inquirenda. Therefore, the present nematodes are assigned to two newly established genera, Euterranova n. gen. [type species E. dentiduplicata n. sp.] and Neoterranova n. gen. [type species N. scoliodontis (Baylis, 1931) n. comb.], based mainly on different labial structures. Euterranova dentiduplicata n. sp. from the stomach of S. fasciatum is mainly characterized by the presence of lips with two rows of denticles. Innominate specimens of Euterranova (a female and a third-stage larva) were collected from the digestive tract of T. obesus. Specimens of N. scoliodontis were recorded from G. cuvier. The two named species are described based on light and scanning electron microscopical examinations. Neoterranova scoliodontis has previously been recorded in New Caledonian waters from the same host species. Species previously attributed to Terranova are transferred to Euterranova (5 species), Neoterranova (4 species) or considered species inquirendae (10 species). Since Pseudoterranova Mozgovoy, 1950 was found to be a nomen nudum according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the available name of this genus is Pseudoterranova Mozgovoy, 1953. A key to Porrocaecum-like nematode genera (Porrocaecum, Pseudoterranova, Pulchrascaris, Euterranova, and Neoterranova) is provided.
787	33184517	Sharks, rays and skates (Chondrichthyes, Elasmobranchii) from the Upper Marine Molasse (middle Burdigalian, early Miocene) of the Simssee area (Bavaria, Germany), with comments on palaeogeographic and ecological patterns.	Elasmobranch remains are quite common in Miocene deposits and were the subject of numerous studies since the middle of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, the taxonomic diversity of the Marine Molasse sharks, rays and skates is still largely unknown. Here, we describe 37 taxa from the lower Miocene of the Molasse Basin: 21 taxa could be identified at species level, whereas 15 taxa could only be assigned to genus and one taxon is left as order incertae sedis. The material was collected from deposits of the Auwiesholz Member of the Achen Formation (middle Burdigalian, middle Ottnangian age, ca. 17.8 Ma) exposed near Simssee, Upper Bavaria. This faunal assemblage is a mixture of shallow marine, near-coastal, pelagic and deep-water taxa. The fauna from Simssee displays different biogeographic dynamics at local and regional scales, possibly related to the intense climatic, oceanographic and tectonic events that occurred during the Eggenburgian-Ottnangian stages. The faunal relationships of the early Miocene chondrichthyan faunas from the Mediterranean Sea and Paratethys with others regions are established on the basis of qualitative (presence/absence) data. The beta diversity (Sørensen-Dice coefficient) of the Miocene Molasse elasmobranchs was used to characterize the taxonomic differentiation between localities and regions. According to our results, the fauna from Simssee shows close similarities with those from Switzerland, Austria, France and northern Germany. Faunal similarities and differences are mainly related to tectonic events and oceanographic variables (i.e. migration through seaway passages) or might represent collecting biases.
788	33182725	Fibre-Reinforced Composite for Protection against Shark Bites.	The number of shark attacks resulting in fatalities and severe injuries has increased steadily over recent years. This is mainly attributed to a growing population participating in ocean sports such as swimming, diving, and surfing. To mitigate the severity of shark attacks, the current study presents a novel fibre-reinforced composite for bite protection. This material is intended for integration into neoprene wetsuits, e.g., in the form of protective pads. A suitable material must be able to withstand significant bite forces, which are concentrated within a small contact area at the tips of the shark teeth. At the same time, the material should not hinder the complex motion sequences of aquatic sports. To this end, a novel fibre-reinforced composite was created by integrating Kevlar fibres into an elastic matrix. Uni-axial testing using shark teeth replicas was conducted on a specially designed test rig to quantify the effectiveness of the novel protective material.
789	33181997	Legacy and emerging organic contaminants in two sympatric shark species from Reunion Island (Southwest Indian Ocean): Levels, profiles and maternal transfer.	The contamination of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) by legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and emerging organic contaminants was investigated in specimens from Reunion Island (Southwest Indian Ocean) in 2018 and 2019. Contamination levels were determined in the muscle of adult individuals of both sexes in relation to biological and trophic parameters. Maternal transfer was additionally investigated in one set of embryos in each species. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organochlorinated pesticide (OCP) and perfluoroalkylated substance (PFAS) concentrations were 2597 ± 2969, 785 ± 966 and 267 ± 194 pg g-1 ww, respectively, in bull sharks, and 339 ± 270, 1025 ± 946 and 144 ± 53 pg g-1 ww in tiger sharks. The results highlighted higher PCB contamination, and by the heavier congeners, in adult bull sharks versus tiger sharks. The significant differences found in PCB profiles and concentrations suggest that the two species are exposed to different contamination sources. As bull sharks rely on a more coastal habitat for feeding, their higher contamination by PCBs suggests the occurrence of local PCB sources. DDT concentrations were similar in both species, suggesting a more homogeneous contamination on the scale of the Southwest Indian Ocean. Female bull sharks showed lower OCP and PCB concentrations than males, while this trend was not observed in tiger sharks. The ratio of chlorinated contaminants in muscle between the mother and her embryos was related to molecule hydrophobicity in bull shark but not in tiger shark, suggesting that shark mode of gestation, known to be different in the two species, is a key driver of organic contaminant maternal transfer. Finally, the results show that organic contaminant levels in the studied species were lower than those of other shark species in the Southern Hemisphere, related to the limited urbanization and industrialization of Reunion Island.
790	33181965	Are concentrations of pollutants in sharks, rays and skates (Elasmobranchii) a cause for concern? A systematic review.	This review represents a comprehensive analysis on pollutants in elasmobranchs including meta-analysis on the most studied pollutants: mercury, cadmium, PCBs and DDTs, in muscle and liver tissue. Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products. Wider screening studies are recommended to determine the risk to elasmobranchs from emerging pollutants and more robust studies are recommended to assess the risks to human health.
791	33179423	Genome-scale target capture of mitochondrial and nuclear environmental DNA from water samples.	Environmental DNA (eDNA) provides a promising supplement to traditional sampling methods for population genetic inferences, but current studies have almost entirely focused on short mitochondrial markers. Here, we develop one mitochondrial and one nuclear set of target capture probes for the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and test them on seawater samples collected in Qatar to investigate the potential of target capture for eDNA-based population studies. The mitochondrial target capture successfully retrieved ~235× (90× - 352× per base position) coverage of the whale shark mitogenome. Using a minor allele frequency of 5%, we find 29 variable sites throughout the mitogenome, indicative of at least five contributing individuals. We also retrieved numerous mitochondrial reads from an abundant nontarget species, mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis), showing a clear relationship between sequence similarity to the capture probes and the number of captured reads. The nuclear target capture probes retrieved only a few reads and polymorphic variants from the whale shark, but we successfully obtained millions of reads and thousands of polymorphic variants with different allele frequencies from E. affinis. We demonstrate that target capture of complete mitochondrial genomes and thousands of nuclear loci is possible from aquatic eDNA samples. Our results highlight that careful probe design, taking into account the range of divergence between target and nontarget sequences as well as presence of nontarget species at the sampling site, is crucial to consider. eDNA sampling coupled with target capture approaches provide an efficient means with which to retrieve population genomic data from aggregating and spawning aquatic species.
792	33174197	Angel sharks (Squatinidae): A review of biological knowledge and exploitation.	Angel sharks (Squatina spp.) are distributed in warm temperate to tropical waters around the world. Many species occur in shelf seas and exhibit seasonal inshore-offshore migrations, moving inshore to give birth. Consequently, there can be high spatial overlap of angel shark populations with fisheries and other human activities. Their dorso-ventrally flattened body shape, large size (most species attain >100 cm total length, L

794	33171468	Convergence of Olfactory Inputs within the Central Nervous System of a Cartilaginous and a Bony Fish: An Anatomical Indicator of Olfactory Sensitivity.	The volume of the olfactory bulbs (OBs) relative to the brain has been used previously as a proxy for olfactory capabilities in many vertebrate taxa, including fishes. Although this gross approach has predictive power, a more accurate assessment of the number of afferent olfactory inputs and the convergence of this information at the level of the telencephalon is critical to our understanding of the role of olfaction in the behaviour of fishes. In this study, we used transmission electron microscopy to assess the number of first-order axons within the olfactory nerve (ON) and the number of second-order axons in the olfactory peduncle (OP) in established model species within cartilaginous (brownbanded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum [CP]) and bony (common goldfish, Carassius auratus [CA]) fishes. The total number of axons varied from a mean of 18.12 ± 7.50 million in the ON to a mean of 0.38 ± 0.21 million in the OP of CP, versus 0.48 ± 0.16 million in the ON and 0.09 ± 0.02 million in the OP of CA. This resulted in a convergence ratio of approximately 50:1 and 5:1, respectively, for these two species. Based on astroglial ensheathing, axon type (unmyelinated [UM] and myelinated [M]) and axon size, we found no differentiated tracts in the OP of CP, whereas a lateral and a medial tract (both of which could be subdivided into two bundles or areas) were identified for CA, as previously described. Linear regression analyses revealed significant differences not only in axon density between species and locations (nerves and peduncles), but also in axon type and axon diameter (p < 0.05). However, UM axon diameter was larger in the OPs than in the nerve in both species (p = 0.005), with no significant differences in UM axon diameter in the ON (p = 0.06) between species. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the neuroanatomical organisation of the ascending olfactory pathway in two fish taxa and a quantitative anatomical comparison of the summation of olfactory information. Our results support the assertion that relative OB volume is a good indicator of the level of olfactory input and thereby a proxy for olfactory capabilities.
795	33168918	A first look at the metabolic rate of Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) in the Canadian Arctic.	Metabolic rate is intricately linked to the ecology of organisms and can provide a framework to study the behaviour, life history, population dynamics, and trophic impact of a species. Acquiring measures of metabolic rate, however, has proven difficult for large water-breathing animals such as sharks, greatly limiting our understanding of the energetic lives of these highly threatened and ecologically important fish. Here, we provide the first estimates of resting and active routine metabolic rate for the longest lived vertebrate, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus). Estimates were acquired through field respirometry conducted on relatively large-bodied sharks (33-126 kg), including the largest individual shark studied via respirometry. We show that despite recording very low whole-animal resting metabolic rates for this species, estimates are within the confidence intervals predicted by derived interspecies allometric and temperature scaling relationships, suggesting this species may not be unique among sharks in this respect. Additionally, our results do not support the theory of metabolic cold adaptation which assumes that polar species maintain elevated metabolic rates to cope with the challenges of life at extreme cold temperatures.
796	33164287	Phylogenomics and species delimitation for effective conservation of manta and devil rays.	Practical biodiversity conservation relies on delineation of biologically meaningful units. Manta and devil rays (Mobulidae) are threatened worldwide, yet morphological similarities and a succession of recent taxonomic changes impede the development of an effective conservation strategy. Here, we generate genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a geographically and taxonomically representative set of manta and devil ray samples to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and evaluate species boundaries under the general lineage concept. We show that nominal species units supported by alternative data sources constitute independently evolving lineages, and find robust evidence for a putative new species of manta ray in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, we uncover substantial incomplete lineage sorting indicating that rapid speciation together with standing variation in ancestral populations has driven phylogenetic uncertainty within Mobulidae. Finally, we detect cryptic diversity in geographically distinct populations, demonstrating that management below the species level may be warranted in certain species. Overall, our study provides a framework for molecular genetic species delimitation that is relevant to wide-ranging taxa of conservation concern, and highlights the potential for genomic data to support effective management, conservation and law enforcement strategies.
797	33161579	Donsol: an important reproductive habitat for the world's largest fish Rhincodon typus?	Little is known about the reproductive ecology of the whale shark Rhincodon typus. On 15 March 2020, a free-swimming neonate whale shark was found in the shallow, coastal waters of Donsol, Philippines. The total length of the male shark was 60 cm, falling within the species known size-at-birth. This is the third occurrence of neonatal whale sharks reported in the area, and coupled with the occurrence of juveniles and adults, and anecdotal mating and precopulatory behaviour reported herein, the importance of the site for this endangered species is highlighted.
798	33161578	Variation of body condition and plasma energy substrates with life stage, sex, and season in wild-sampled nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum.	Reported here are the relationships among morphological (i.e., body condition) and biochemical (i.e., plasma concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies and ketone body ratios) parameters related to energy storage and use, as well as the variation of such parameters, for 107 free-ranging nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum sampled off South Florida. Immature G. cirratum exhibited a higher variance in body condition, plasma free fatty acid concentrations and ketone body ratios compared to adults. Mature female G. cirratum had significantly higher body condition than mature males, driven by a seasonal increase in mature female body condition during the wet season. Mature male G. cirratum showed a decrease in the ketone body β-hydroxybutyric acid during the dry season. Taken together, this study provides a baseline assessment of body condition and internal physiological state for a data-poor marine species and demonstrates significant ontogenetic, sexual and seasonal variation in G. cirratum energetic state. As concluded by other studies of energy metabolism in free-ranging sharks, this research highlights the importance of considering intraspecific patterns and sampling context for inferring the drivers of variation.
799	33161090	Comparative study of cartilaginous fish divulges insights into the early evolution of primary, secondary and mucosal lymphoid tissue architecture.	Cartilaginous fish are located at a pivotal point in phylogeny where the adaptive immune system begins to resemble that of other, more-derived jawed vertebrates, including mammals. For this reason, sharks and other cartilaginous fish are ideal models for studying the natural history of immunity. Insights from such studies may include distinguishing the (evolutionarily conserved) fundamental aspects of adaptive immunity from the (more recent) accessory. Some lymphoid tissues of sharks, including the thymus and spleen, resemble those of mammals in both appearance and function. The cartilaginous skeleton of sharks has no bone marrow, which is also absent in bony fish despite calcified bone, but cartilaginous fish have other Leydig's and epigonal organs that function to provide hematopoiesis analogous to mammalian bone marrow. Conserved across all vertebrate phylogeny in some form is gut-associated lymphoid tissues, or GALT, which is seen from agnathans to mammals. Though it takes many forms, from typhlosole in lamprey to Peyer's patches in mammals, the GALT serves as a site of antigen concentration and exposure to lymphocytes in the digestive tract. Though more complex lymphoid organs are not present in agnathans, they have several primitive tissues, such as the thymoid and supraneural body, that appear to serve their variable lymphocyte receptor-based adaptive immune system. There are several similarities between the adaptive immune structures in cartilaginous and bony fish, such as the thymus and spleen, but there are mechanisms employed in bony fish that in some instances bridge their adaptive immune systems to that of tetrapods. This review summarizes what we know of lymphoid tissues in cartilaginous fishes and uses these data to compare primary and secondary tissues in jawless, cartilaginous, and bony fishes to contextualize the early natural history of vertebrate mucosal immune tissues.
800	33159152	Cell culture-based karyotyping of orectolobiform sharks for chromosome-scale genome analysis.	Karyotyping, traditionally performed using cytogenetic techniques, is indispensable for validating genome assemblies whose sequence lengths can be scaled up to chromosome sizes using modern methods. Karyotype reports of chondrichthyans are scarce because of the difficulty in cell culture. Here, we focused on carpet shark species and the culture conditions for fibroblasts and lymphocytes. The utility of the cultured cells enabled the high-fidelity characterization of their karyotypes, namely 2n = 102 for the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) and zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum), and 2n = 106 for the brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) and whitespotted bamboo shark (C. plagiosum). We identified heteromorphic XX/XY sex chromosomes for the two latter species and demonstrated the first-ever fluorescence in situ hybridization of shark chromosomes prepared from cultured cells. Our protocols are applicable to diverse chondrichthyan species and will deepen the understanding of early vertebrate evolution at the molecular level.
801	33158068	Physiological Impairment as a Result of Bile Accumulation in an Apex Predator, the Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Péron &amp; Lesueur, 1822).	Physiological adaptations have evolved to help sharks face rapid periods of feast. Tiger sharks are generalist apex predators that rely on a high-lipid/protein diet. To achieve a satisfactory nutritional condition, proper lipid absorption and hepatic storage are needed. Bile secretion in sharks is low and sporadic but increases during short periods of fasting. The present study describes a physiological impairment caused by bile accumulation in juvenile tiger sharks, possibly due to prolonged fasting. These evidences suggest that, even though sharks have adaptations that prevent them from dying from starvation, alarming physiological alterations might occur. Future studies are needed to assess how such a condition can affect wild populations, as well as possible sublethal consequences that could impact their long-term survival.
802	33152021	Transport variability over the Hawkesbury Shelf (31.5-34.5°S) driven by the East Australian Current.	The Hawkesbury Bioregion located off southeastern Australia (31.5-34.5oS) is a region of highly variable circulation. The region spans the typical separation point of the East Australian Current (EAC), the western boundary current that dominates the flow along the coast of SE Australia. It lies adjacent to a known ocean warming hotspot in the Tasman Sea, and is a region of high productivity. However, we have limited understanding of the circulation, temperature regimes and shelf transport in this region, and the drivers of variability. We configure a high resolution (750m) numerical model for the Hawkesbury Shelf region nested inside 2 data assimilating models of decreasing resolution, to obtain the best estimate of the shelf circulation and transport over a 2-yr period (2012-2013). Here we show that the transport is driven by the mesoscale EAC circulation that strengthens in summer and is related to the separation of the EAC jet from the coast. Transport estimates show strong offshore export is a maximum between 32-33oS. Median offshore transports range 2.5-8.4Sv seasonally and are a maximum during in summer driven by the separation of the EAC jet from the coast. The transport is more variable downstream of the EAC separation, driven by the EAC eddy field. Onshore transport occurs more frequently off Sydney 33.5-34.5oS; seasonal medians range -1.7 to 2.3Sv, with an onshore maximum in winter. The region is biologically productive, and it is a known white shark nursery area despite the dominance of the oligotrophic western boundary current. Hence an understanding of the drivers of circulation and cross-shelf exchange is important.
803	33150082	Genomics versus mtDNA for resolving stock structure in the silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis).	Conservation genetic approaches for elasmobranchs have focused on regions of the mitochondrial genome or a handful of nuclear microsatellites. High-throughput sequencing offers a powerful alternative for examining population structure using many loci distributed across the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. These single nucleotide polymorphisms are expected to provide finer scale and more accurate population level data; however, there have been few genomic studies applied to elasmobranch species. The desire to apply next-generation sequencing approaches is often tempered by the costs, which can be offset by pooling specimens prior to sequencing (pool-seq). In this study, we assess the utility of pool-seq by applying this method to the same individual silky sharks, 
804	33149751	The Therapeutic Effect of Shark Liver Oil in a Rat Model of Acetic Acid-Induced Ulcerative Colitis.	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the most well-known types of inflammatory bowel disease that manifests as recurrent inflammation of rectum and colon. The goal of this study is to evaluate the protective effects of shark liver oil (SLO) on acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis in rats. Eighty induced UC rats were randomly divided into ten equal groups and received the following treatments for seven days: 1 ml of normal saline rectally, 1 ml of gel base (carboxymethyl cellulose) rectally, 10 mg/kg of Asacol rectally, 10 mg/kg of mesalazine orally, 5% gel form of SLO rectally, 10% gel form of SLO rectally, 200 mg of SLO orally, and 400 mg of SLO orally. We examined the oxidative stress indices, histopathological features, and body weight changes, as well as the function of the liver and kidneys at the end of treatment. Administration of 10% rectal and 400 mg oral SLO resulted in a significant weight gain. Also, glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly higher in 5% and 10% SLO-treated groups, and elevated superoxide dismutase activity in rats that received 5% SLO was observed compared to negative control and Asacol groups. While no significant changes were observed in most of the kidney and liver function markers, higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase were detected in the group that received 400 mg SLO orally compared to negative control and Asacol groups. Many histopathological signs of improvement were observed in mesalazine, Asacol, and SLO groups. There were no significant changes detected in the mean rank among different groups. Our data indicate that SLO supplementation could improve the amelioration of acetic acid-induced UC in rats due to its antioxidant effects.
805	33144597	Fish telocytes and their relation to rodlet cells in ruby-red-fin shark (rainbow shark) Epalzeorhynchos frenatum (Teleostei: Cyprinidae).	Telocytes comprise the major constituents of the supportive interstitial framework within the various organs. They form a 3D network between different types of stromal and non-stromal cells, which makes them distinctively vital. We have previously explored the origin of the peculiar rodlet cells, especially on their differential stages in aquatic species. The current study aimed at highlighting the relation of telocytes with different rodlet stages. Samples of fish, olfactory organs, and gills were processed for semi thin sections, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. It was evident in the study that telocytes formed a 3D interstitial network, entrapping stem cells and differentiating rodlet cells, to establish direct contact with stem cells. Differentiated stem cells and rodlet progenitor cells, practically in the granular and transitional stages, also formed ultrastructure junctional modifications, by which nanostructures are formed to establish cell contact with telocytes. Telocytes in turn also connected with macrophage progenitor cells. Telocytes (TCs) expressed CD34, CD117, VEGF, and MMP-9. In conclusion, telocytes established direct contact with the stem and rodlet cells in various differential stages. Telocytes may vitally influence stem/progenitor cell differentiation, regulate rodlet cell function, and express MPP-9 that may regulate immune cells functions especially, including movement and migration ability.
806	33140133	Do metaphorical sharks bite? Simulation and abstraction in metaphor processing.	In a metaphor such as lawyers are sharks, the concept lawyers, which is the metaphor topic, and the concept sharks, which is the metaphor vehicle, interact to produce a figurative meaning such that lawyers are predatory. Some theorists argue that sensorimotor properties of the vehicle are the basis of metaphor comprehension. Accordingly, the metaphor lawyers are sharks is processed as a simulation in which bodily actions related to sharks are accessed (e.g., sharks chasing prey). In contrast, the long-standing assumption is that metaphors are processed as abstractions with no role played by sensorimotor properties. From this theoretical perspective, abstract characteristics of sharks (e.g., vicious, predatory) are argued to be the core properties involved in metaphor processing. Here, we juxtapose these two opposing views of metaphor processing using cross-modal lexical priming. We find evidence that low-familiar metaphors (e.g., highways are snakes) prime bodily-action associates (i.e., slither) but not abstraction associates (i.e., danger), and are hence processed via simulation, whereas high-familiar metaphors (e.g., lawyers are sharks) prime abstraction associates (i.e., killer) but not bodily-action associates (i.e., bite) and are therefore processed via abstraction. The results align with views of cognition and language that posit the presence of both embodied and abstract representations.
807	33128012	Histological evidence for secretory bioluminescence from pectoral pockets of the American Pocket Shark (Mollisquama mississippiensis).	The function of pocket shark pectoral pockets has puzzled scientists over decades. Here, we show that the pockets of the American Pocket Shark (Mollisquama mississippiensis) contain a brightly fluorescent stratified cubic epithelium enclosed in a pigmented sheath and in close contact with the basal cartilage of the pectoral fins; cells of this epithelium display a centripetal gradient in size and a centrifuge gradient in fluorescence. These results strongly support the idea that pocket shark's pockets are exocrine holocrine glands capable of discharging a bioluminescent fluid, potentially upon a given movement of the pectoral fin. Such capability has been reported in many other marine organisms and is typically used as a close-range defensive trick. In situ observations would be required to confirm this hypothesis.
808	33126081	Cartilaginous fish class II genes reveal unprecedented old allelic lineages and confirm the late evolutionary emergence of DM.	Cartilaginous fish (chimaeras, rays and sharks) are the most basal extant jawed vertebrates with an adaptive immune system based on the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC). Despite being a key taxon in the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity, no comprehensive characterization of MHC class II genes has been undertaken for the group. We performed extensive bioinformatic searches on a taxonomically diverse dataset of transcriptomes and genomes of cartilaginous fish targeting MHC class II sequences. Class IIα and IIβ sequences were retrieved from all taxa analyzed and showed typical features of classical class II genes. Phylogenetic trees of the immunoglobulin superfamily domain showed two divergent and remarkably ancient lineages of class II genes in Selachians (sharks), originating >350 million years ago. Close linkage of lineage-specific pairs of IIα and IIβ genes was found, confirming previous results, with genes from distinct lineages segregating as alleles. Nonclassical class II DM sequences were not retrieved from these data and classical class II sequences lacked the conserved residues shown to interact with DM molecules, supporting claims that the DM system arose only in the lobe-finned fish lineage leading to tetrapods. Based on our search methods, other divergent class II genes are unlikely in cartilaginous fish.
809	33119595	Catch composition and life history characteristics of sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii) landed in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India.	Detailed information on shark and ray fisheries in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India are limited, including information on the diversity and biological characteristics of these species. We carried out fish landing surveys in South Andamans from January 2017 to May 2018, a comprehensive and cost-effective way to fill this data gap. We sampled 5,742 individuals representing 57 shark and ray species landed from six types of fishing gears. Of the 36 species of sharks and 21 species of rays landed, six species of sharks (Loxodon macrorhinus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Sphyrna lewini, C. albimarginatus, C. brevipinna, and Paragaleus randalli) comprised 83.35% of shark landings, while three species of rays (Pateobatis jenkinsii, Himantura leoparda and H. tutul) comprised 48.82% of ray landings, suggesting a species dominance in the catch or fishing region. We provide insights into the biology of species with extensions in maximum size for seven shark species. Additionally, we document an increase in the known ray diversity for the islands and for India with three previously unreported ray species. We found that amongst sharks, mature individuals of small-bodied species (63.48% males of total landings of species less than 1.5 m total length when mature) and immature individuals of larger species (84.79% males of total landings of species larger than 1.5 m total length when mature) were mostly landed; whereas for rays, mature individuals were predominantly landed (80.71% males of total landings) likely reflecting differences in habitat preferences along life-history stages across species and fishing gear. The largest size range in sharks was recorded in landings from pelagic longlines and gillnets. Further, the study emphasizes the overlap between critical habitats and fishing grounds, where immature sharks and gravid females were landed in large quantities which might be unsustainable in the long-term. Landings were female-biased in C. amblyrhynchos, S. lewini and P. jenkinsii, and male-biased in L. macrorhinus and H. leoparda, indicating either spatio-temporal or gear-specific sexual segregation in these species. Understanding seasonal and biological variability in the shark and ray landings over a longer study period across different fisheries will inform future conservation and fishery management measures for these species in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
810	33112858	Horizontal and vertical movements of starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias in the northeast Atlantic.	Commercial landings of starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias in northern European seas are increasing, whilst our knowledge of their ecology, behaviour and population structure remains limited. M. asterias is a widely distributed demersal shark, occupying the waters of the southern North Sea and Irish Sea in the north, to at least the southern Bay of Biscay in the south, and is seasonally abundant in UK waters. There are no species-specific management measures for the northeast Atlantic stock, and the complexity of its population structure is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, we deployed both mark-recapture and electronic tags on M. asterias to gain novel insights into its horizontal and vertical movements. Our data suggest that the habitat use of M. asterias changes on a seasonal basis, with associated changes in geographical distribution, depth utilisation and experienced temperature. We report the first direct evidence of philopatry for this species, and also provide initial evidence of sex-biased dispersal and potential metapopulation-like stock structuring either side of the UK continental shelf. Investigations of finer-scale vertical movements revealed clear diel variation in vertical activity. The illustrated patterns of seasonal space-use and behaviour will provide important information to support the stock assessment process and will help inform any future management options.
811	33111319	The use of muscle lipids and fatty acids to assess shark diet and condition.	Following a lack of detected change in white shark Carcharodon carcharias L. 1758 diet and nutritional condition attributed to the interaction with the cage-diving industry, Lusseau and Derous (Tourism Management, 2019, 75, 547-549) cautioned the use of muscle lipids and fatty acids in this context, advocating for other biomarkers. This study provides additional evidence from peer-reviewed literature to contend the usefulness of elasmobranch muscle fatty acid profiles to detail diet and habitat use. It also presents findings from a controlled experiment on captive Port Jackson sharks Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Meyer 1793) whereby long-term (daily for 33 days) 3 min exhaustive chase exercise changed muscle lipid class profiles, supporting its use to infer nutritional condition after activities such as interactions with wildlife tourism operators. Conversely, the unaltered muscle fatty acid and lipid content suggests their use in trophic ecology is not confounded by activities such as interacting with tourism operators, remaining useful biomarkers to investigate diet and habitat use.
812	33108982	Coastal sharks supply the global shark fin trade.	Progress in global shark conservation has been limited by constraints to understanding the species composition and geographic origins of the shark fin trade. Previous assessments that relied on earlier genetic techniques and official trade records focused on abundant pelagic species traded between Europe and Asia. Here, we combine recent advances in DNA barcoding and species distribution modelling to identify the species and source the geographic origin of fins sold at market. Derived models of species environmental niches indicated that shark fishing effort is concentrated within Exclusive Economic Zones, mostly in coastal Australia, Indonesia, the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Japan. By coupling two distinct tools, barcoding and niche modelling, our results provide new insights for monitoring and enforcement. They suggest stronger local controls of coastal fishing may help regulate the unsustainable global trade in shark fins.
813	33107039	Functional Morphology of the Feeding Apparatus of the Snaggletooth Shark, Hemipristis elongata (Carcharhiniformes: Hemigaleidae).	The anatomy of the feeding apparatus of the snaggletooth shark, Hemipristis elongata (Klunzinger, 1871) is illustrated in detail from the dissection of three heads. Two new muscles are described: the Adductor mandibularis internus and the Levator mandibularis. A subdivision of the Levator palatoquadrati is described and named the Pronator subdivision of the Levator palatoquadrati. Also, eight new anatomical features associated with the mandibular arch and with the chondrocranium (CR) are described. Three are cartilages: the suprapalatine cartilages, the craniopalatoquadrate cartilage and the calcified Meckelian dental fold. The remaining five features are processes: the Pronator process of the palatoquadrate (PQ), the Levator palatoquadrati alpha process, the proquadrate process, the ectorbital process (ECP) and the Meckelian Intermandibularis ridge. Some of them are not restricted to H.elongata. The function of these new muscles and anatomical features is discussed and a hypothesis about the functional morphology of the feeding apparatus of the snaggletooth shark is proposed. The extent and the assumptive importance of the pronation of the mandibular arch in the snaggletooth shark feeding behaviour is described and discussed. An alternative for the main function of the Levator palatoquadrati as hypothesized by Motta et al. (1997) and Wilga et al. (2001) is proposed for the families Hemigaleidae, Carcharhinidae and Sphyrnidae. We anticipate this muscle is more involved in the pronation rather than in the protrusion of the mandibular arch.
814	33104292	Simple, once-off mapping of various, recurrent immunostaining patterns of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in spermatogonia at the immature pole of the testis of adult wild-caught blue shark, Prionace glauca: Correlations with changes in testicular status.	This study was a single time-point mapping of various immunostaining patterns revealed with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) PC10 antibody in spermatogonia at the immature pole of the testis of the Blue shark (Prionace glauca). Scattered in the stroma of the germinal ridge that demarcates the immature pole's outer boundary were nests of variously immunoreactive A-spermatogonia, each flanked by a fusiform cell. Spermatocysts were assembled from niche-derived stromal cells, displaced A-progenitors, and their progeny, which showed one of two main immunostaining patterns (i.e., an uneven light brown/globular and homogeneous dark [hod] brown appearance). The testes of wild-caught Prionace showed two conditions, namely, extensive multinucleate cell death (MNC) near the mitosis-meiosis transition or an early recovery phase from the latter showing vacuolated areas. Both the proportion of cysts with immature B

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of the State of Hawai'i Division of Aquatic Resources Shark Incidents List between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2019. Trauma registry data and medical records of patients treated for SRIs at the only level 1 trauma center in Hawai'i were reviewed.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients sustained SRIs in the Hawaiian Islands: 25 in Maui, 16 in O'ahu, 12 in Hawai'i, and 8 in Kaua'i. In cases where the shark species could be identified, tiger sharks were the most frequent (25, 41%). Four cases were fatal-all died on scene in Maui with the shark species unknown. Forty-five survivors (79%) received definitive care at regional facilities. Twelve (21%) were treated at the level 1 trauma center, of which two were transferred in for higher level of care. Of the 12 patients, 11 (92%) had extremity injuries, with 3 lower extremity amputations (25%), 2 with vascular injuries (17%), and 5 with nerve injuries (42%). One had an injury to the abdomen. All patients had local bleeding control in the prehospital setting, with 9 (75%) tourniquets and 3 (25%) hemostatic/pressure dressings applied for truncal or proximal extremity injuries. The mean time from injury to emergency department arrival was 63 minutes.
DISCUSSION: Most SRIs are managed at regional facilities, rather than at a level 1 trauma center. Prehospital hemorrhage control is an important survival skill as time to definitive care may be prolonged. For cases treated at the level 1 trauma center, nerve injuries were common and should be suspected even in the absence of major vascular injury. Correlating shark behavior with observed injury patterns may help improve public awareness and ocean safety.

816	33087802	A globally threatened shark, Carcharias taurus, shows no population decline in South Africa.	Knowledge about the demographic histories of natural populations helps to evaluate their conservation status, and potential impacts of natural and anthropogenic pressures. In particular, estimates of effective population size obtained through molecular data can provide useful information to guide management decisions for vulnerable populations. The spotted ragged-tooth shark, Carcharias taurus (also known as the sandtiger or grey nurse shark), is widely distributed in warm-temperate and subtropical waters, but has suffered severe population declines across much of its range as a result of overexploitation. Here, we used multilocus genotype data to investigate the demographic history of the South African C. taurus population. Using approximate Bayesian computation and likelihood-based importance sampling, we found that the population underwent a historical range expansion that may have been linked to climatic changes during the late Pleistocene. There was no evidence for a recent anthropogenic decline. Together with census data suggesting a stable population, these results support the idea that fishing pressure and other threats have so far not been detrimental to the local C. taurus population. The results reported here indicate that South Africa could possibly harbour the last remaining, relatively pristine population of this widespread but vulnerable top predator.
817	33087793	Variable response to electric shark deterrents in bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas.	Although relatively rare, human-shark interactions and sharks bites are increasing globally, which has led to the development of various mitigation measures. Electric shark deterrents (ESDs) have, so far, been the most effective personal deterrents, but have only been scientifically tested on one of the species most frequently responsible for shark bites, i.e. white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). We tested the effectiveness of five ESDs (E-Shark Force, NoShark, Rpela v2, Freedom + Surf, Freedom + Surf-Shortboard) on bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, over a period of 21 days in September 2019, in New Caledonia. Standardised bait was attached 30 cm below an experimental board that had an active ESD for up to 15 min, or until a bull shark touched the bait or the board. We compared the numbers of baits taken, numbers of passes and reactions around the board, as well as the distance between the sharks and the board among ESDs and against a control board with bait and no active ESD. The Freedom + Surf was the most effective ESD, reducing the amounts of baits taken by 42.3%, while the Rpela v2 and Freedom + Surf-Shortboard also significantly reduced the number of baits taken by 16.5% and 16.2% respectively. Mean distance between sharks and the bait was not affected by the ESDs, but the number of approaches and the proportion of reactions were both significantly higher when the Freedom + Surf was active compared to other ESDs. The effectiveness of all ESDs decreased over time, with the likelihood of the bait being taken increasing and the number of approaches and distance between sharks and the bait decreasing. Our findings show that the ability of ESDs to deter bull shark varies between products, with the Freedom + Surf resulting in the most behavioural changes, followed by the Rpela v2 and Freedom + Surf-Shortboard. However, none of the products tested completely stopped sharks from taking the bait.
818	33083504	Standardized data to support conservation prioritization for sharks and batoids (Elasmobranchii).	We collated and synthesized information on 1,226 Elasmobranch species (i.e., sharks, rays, and skates) globally from a wide range of sources. We obtained curated and standardized data from online databases, legal documents, press releases, and websites. All data were standardized according to the taxonomic nomenclature described in the Catalogue of Life. We grouped data into five categories: 1) biological information, 2) conservation status, 3) management opportunities, 4) use, and 5) inclusion in international conventions and treaties. For species biological information, we included migration, habitat, species characteristics such as length & body weight, their threat to humans, life-history trait data availability from FishBase, whether the species was listed on the Global Register of Migratory Species, the presence of occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), information on genomics from GenBank, and species evolutionary distinctiveness scores. For conservation status, we recorded threat status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species™ and inclusion in the Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). For management opportunities, we identified species under human care in zoos and aquariums in the Species360 network, species under management in studbooks from the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the American Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and the Zoo and Aquarium Association Australasia (ZAA), as well as data on recovery, management, and action plans at the class, family, and species levels. For use, we collated species-level data on international trade levels from the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Trade Database, as used in aquaculture, as bait, and as gamefish, recording the purpose of the trade according to the IUCN Red List and the global catches reported to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). Finally, we collated information from seven international conventions and treaties: CITES, UNCLOS (the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea), CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals), Shark MoU (the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks), BERN (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats), OSPAR (Protecting and conserving the North-East Atlantic and its resources), and the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean. Our data are comparable across databases and will assist further research on in-situ and ex-situ population management for sharks and batoids. Our data can be of use to international policy makers, aquarium curators, management authorities, conservation practitioners, and scientists interested in prioritizing Elasmobranchs for conservation.
819	33079371	Understanding non-compliance in small-scale fisheries: Shark fishing in Myanmar's Myeik Archipelago.	Achieving fisheries compliance is challenging in contexts where enforcement capacity is limited and the incentives for rule-breaking are strong. This challenge is exemplified in Myanmar, where an active shark fishery exists despite a nationwide ban on targeted shark fishing. We used the Kipling method (5W1H) to gather a complete story of non-compliance in five small-scale fishing communities in the Myeik Archipelago. Among 144 fishers surveyed, 49% were aware of the nationwide ban. Shark fishers (24%) tended to be younger individuals who did not own a boat and perceived shark fishing to be prevalent. Compliant fishers were motivated by a fear of sharks and lack of capacity (equipment, knowledge), whereas food and income were cited as key motivations for non-compliance. The results of our study emphasize that in resource-dependent communities, improving compliance for effective shark conservation may require addressing broader issues of poverty, food security and the lack of alternatives.
820	33075739	Combining chemistry and topography to fight biofilm formation: Fabrication of micropatterned surfaces with a peptide-based coating.	This paper describes the fabrication of antifouling surfaces by the combination of topography and peptide chemistry. The topography of the surface mimics the skin of the shark that can resist biofouling by having a certain microtopography. A peptide-based coating that resists fouling self-assembles on these surfaces. In biofilm formation assays, performed under static conditions, the resulting combination (micropattern with peptide coating) has superior antifouling properties against the Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains tested (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively) when compared to both micropatterned and peptide-coated surfaces. The same behavior was observed in dynamic assays performed in a parallel plate flow chamber (PPFC) setup, where E. coli could not attach to the micropatterned surface coated with peptide during the 30 min of initial adhesion. These assays, mimicking physiological shear stress conditions, suggest that the peptide-coated surface with micropatterned topography may be promising in reducing adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in biomedical devices such as urinary catheters and stents, and cardiovascular, dental and orthopedic implants.
822	33060667	Coexisting with sharks: a novel, socially acceptable and non-lethal shark mitigation approach.	Conflict between humans and large predators is a longstanding challenge that can present negative consequences for humans and wildlife. Sharks have a global distribution and are considered to pose a potential threat to humans; concurrently many shark species are themselves threatened. Developing strategies for coexistence between humans and this keystone group is imperative. We assess blimp surveillance as a technique to simply and effectively reduce shark encounters at ocean beaches and determine the social acceptance of this technique as compared to an established mitigation strategy-shark meshing. We demonstrate the suitability of blimps for risk mitigation, with detection probabilities of shark analogues by professional lifeguards of 0.93 in ideal swimming conditions. Social surveys indicate strong social acceptance of blimps and preference for non-lethal shark mitigation. We show that continuous aerial surveillance can provide a measurable reduction in risk from sharks, improving beach safety and facilitating coexistence between people and wildlife.
823	33058250	The fossil record of extant elasmobranchs.	Sharks and their relatives (Elasmobranchii) are highly threatened with extinction due to various anthropogenic pressures. The abundant fossil record of fossil taxa has allowed the tracing of the evolutionary history of modern elasmobranchs to at least 250 MYA; nonetheless, exactly how far back the fossil record of living taxa goes has never been collectively surveyed. In this study, the authors assess the representation and extent of the fossil record of elasmobranchs currently living in our oceans by collecting their oldest records and quantifying first appearance dates at different taxonomic levels (i.e., orders, families, genera and species), ecological traits (e.g., body size, habitat and feeding mechanism) and extinction risks (i.e., threatened, not threatened and data deficient). The results of this study confirm the robust representation of higher taxonomic ranks, with all orders, most of the families and over half of the extant genera having a fossil record. Further, they reveal that 10% of the current global species diversity is represented in the geological past. Sharks are better represented and extend deeper in time than rays and skates. While the fossil record of extant genera (e.g., the six gill sharks, Hexanchus) goes as far back as c. 190 MYA, the fossil record of extant species (e.g., the sand shark, Carcharias taurus Rafinesque 1810) extends c. 66 MYA. Although no significant differences were found in the extent of the fossil record between ecological traits, it was found that the currently threatened species have a significantly older fossil record than the not threatened species. This study demonstrate that the fossil record of extant elasmobranchs extends deep into the geologic time, especially in the case of threatened sharks. As such, the elasmobranch geological history has great potential to advance the understanding of how species currently facing extinction have responded to different stressors in the past, thereby providing a deep-time perspective to conservation.
824	33058201	The use of machine learning to detect foraging behaviour in whale sharks: a new tool in conservation.	In this study we present the first attempt at modelling the feeding behaviour of whale sharks using a machine learning analytical method. A total of eight sharks were monitored with tri-axial accelerometers and their foraging behaviours were visually observed. Our results highlight that the random forest model is a valid and robust approach to predict the feeding behaviour of the whale shark. In conclusion this novel approach exposes the practicality of this method to serve as a conservation tool and the capability it offers in monitoring potential disturbances of the species.
825	33058185	New insights into the trophic ecology of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) from a subtropical estuary in the western Gulf of Mexico.	As environmental change persists, understanding resource use patterns is of value to predict the consequences of shifting trophic structures. While many sharks are opportunistic predators, some exhibit prey selectivity, putting them at higher risk compared to species with greater trophic plasticity. In the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Clupeids and Sciaenids comprise 69% of blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) diets, which is consequential considering potential responses of these prey groups to disturbance and over harvesting. We assessed if blacktips exhibit selectivity for Clupeids and Sciaenids in the western GOM based on stomach contents from sharks in coastal Texas. Clupeids comprised <2% of diets, while striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) comprised >70% of identifiable prey. Ontogenetic shifts from smaller (Clupeids, small Sciaenids) to larger, higher trophic level (Ariidae, Elasmobranchii) prey fits our understanding of foraging among coastal sharks, and suggests our regional understanding of blacktip trophic ecology may be limited by the sizes of sampled sharks. Observed increases in blacktip densities coupled with declines in prey (Mugilids, Sciaenids) is concerning if blacktips have limited diet plasticity. Yet GOM blacktips may be more generalized than previously thought, which is promising for conservation and management.
826	33058146	Observations of coastal aggregations of the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) in Chilean waters.	The presence of four sharks was documented in coastal waters of Antofagasta (Chile) using an unmanned aerial video camera. Fishers took advantage of this aggregation to catch and sold three adult broadnose sevengill sharks Notorynchus cepedianus. Species identity was determined by using the cox1 gene. One additional video was later recorded 3000 km south of Antofagasta, and shows a large female interacting with a salmon farming facility. Shallow water records of N. cepedianus were previously undocumented in Chilean waters, yet historically have provided an opportunistic event to fishers in Chile.
827	33055305	Isolation and molecular identification of Aeromonas species from the tank water of ornamental fishes.	Aeromonads are recognised as important pathogens of fishes. In this study, ten water samples were randomly collected from pet shops' fish tanks and home aquaria inhabited by several fish species (silver arowana, koi, goldfish, catfish, pictus fish, silver shark and silver dollar fish). Altogether 298 colonies were isolated using Aeromonas selective agar. A total of 154 isolates were then confirmed as belonging to the genus Aeromonas using the GCAT gene. Using ERIC-PCR, a total of 40 duplicate isolates were excluded from the study and 114 isolates were subjected to PCR-RFLP targeting the RNA polymerase sigma factor (rpoD) gene using lab-on-chip. A total of 13 different Aeromonas species were identified. The most prevalent species were A. veronii (27%, 31/114), followed by A. dhakensis (17%, 19/114), A. finlandiensis (9%, 10/114), A. caviae (8%, 9/114), A. hydrophila (4%, 4/114), A. jandaei (4%, 4/114), A. rivuli (3%, 3/114), A. enteropelogens (2%, 2/114), A. tecta (2%, 2/114), A. allosaccharophila (1%, 1/114), A. eucrenophila (1%, 1/114), A. media (1%, 1/114) and A. diversa (1%, 1/114). Twenty-six isolates (23%) were unidentifiable at species level. The present study demonstrates that Aeromonas species are highly diverse in freshwater fish tanks, and suggests the potential risks posed by the isolated bacteria to the health of ornamental fish species.
829	33051497	Synthetic Biology-derived triterpenes as efficacious immunomodulating adjuvants.	The triterpene oil squalene is an essential component of nanoemulsion vaccine adjuvants. It is most notably in the MF59 adjuvant, a component in some seasonal influenza vaccines, in stockpiled, emulsion-based adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines, and with demonstrated efficacy for vaccines to other pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Squalene has historically been harvested from shark liver oil, which is undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this study, we have demonstrated the use of a Synthetic Biology (yeast) production platform to generate squalene and novel triterpene oils, all of which are equally as efficacious as vaccine adjuvants based on physiochemical properties and immunomodulating activities in a mouse model. These Synthetic Biology adjuvants also elicited similar IgG1, IgG2a, and total IgG levels compared to marine and commercial controls when formulated with common quadrivalent influenza antigens. Injection site morphology and serum cytokine levels did not suggest any reactogenic effects of the yeast-derived squalene or novel triterpenes, suggesting their safety in adjuvant formulations. These results support the advantages of yeast produced triterpene oils to include completely controlled growth conditions, just-in-time and scalable production, and the capacity to produce novel triterpenes beyond squalene.
830	33050970	Patterns of Organization of Cerebellum and Spinal Cord of the Red-Tail Shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor): Histological, Morphometrical, and Immunohistochemical Studies.	Teleosts exhibit enormous heterogeneity in brain morphology, especially in the patterns of the organization of cerebellum. The cerebellum of a red-tail shark that we analyzed was well-developed and included three main divisions: the valvula cerebelli, the corpus cerebelli, and the vestibulolateral lobe. Characteristically, the cerebellar cortex contained three well-distinct layers: an outer molecular, intermediate ganglionic, and inner granular layer. The ganglionic layer possessed irregularly arranged Purkinje cells and eurydendroid cells that extended their processes into the molecular layer. Both Purkinje cells and eurydendroid cells showed immunoreactivity for iNOS2. Moreover, astrocytes in the cerebellum showed the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein. The most striking observation in the cerebellum of shark was the lack of deep cerebellar nuclei and a well-identified white matter. On the other hand, the gray substance in the spinal cord displays a characteristic pattern in its organization, in which the dorsal horns lie quite close together, giving the gray substance the shape of an inverted Y and possessing large neurons. Notably, the white matter possessed myelinated nerve fibers. The current study provides the first report on the organization of layers and neurons in the cerebellum and spinal cord of red-tail shark. This research will contribute to the neuroanatomy and evolutionary studies of the brain of Cyprinidae.
831	33050779	Endoskeletal mineralization in chimaera and a comparative guide to tessellated cartilage in chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, rays and chimaera).	An accepted uniting character of modern cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, chimaera) is the presence of a mineralized, skeletal crust, tiled by numerous minute plates called tesserae. Tesserae have, however, never been demonstrated in modern chimaera and it is debated whether the skeleton mineralizes at all. We show for the first time that tessellated cartilage was not lost in chimaera, as has been previously postulated, and is in many ways similar to that of sharks and rays. Tesserae in 
832	33050024	Instagranimal: Animal Welfare and Animal Ethics Challenges of Animal-Based Tourism.	By animal-based tourism, a host of activities offering passive viewing or active interaction with wild, semi-wild or captive animals is included. The multibillion dollar industry is on the rise globally today, offering modes of engagement with animals that trade on increasingly embodied close encounters with non-human animals. As new modes of animal-based tourism proliferate, such as sloth selfies, visiting cat cafes, swimming with sharks and agri-tourism petting zoos, animal welfare standards risk deteriorating. In the following paper, we collate concerns over animal welfare into a discussion on the challenges facing animal-based tourism. Our synthesis is the first to consider the full spectrum of such animal-based tourism: across agri-, hunting, zoo and safari tourism, to name a few, and crossing consumptive and non-consumptive boundaries. A literature review is first provided. Findings are then presented thematically following workshops at an international interdisciplinary symposium of leading tourism, animal welfare, ethics and leisure sciences scholars together with practitioners of the industry. It discusses macrolevel drivers to animal-based tourism as an industry, the problem of cultural relativism and the role of technology in enhancing or promoting the experience. We indicate ways forward toward implementing a compassionate animal-based tourism.
834	33046780	Changes in diving behaviour and habitat use of provisioned whale sharks: implications for management.	Whale shark (Rhincodon typus) tourism is increasingly popular at predictable aggregations around the world, but only a few use provisioning to ensure close interactions. Understanding the effects of provisioning on the behaviour of this endangered species is critical to manage this growing industry. We recorded the diving behaviour and habitat use of juvenile whale sharks (n = 4) for a mean of 49.5 provisioned and 33.8 non-provisioned days using temperature-depth-recorders. We found that time spent at the surface (< 2 m) between 6 am and 1 pm increased ~ sixfold, while timing of deep dives shifted from 4-10 am to 10 am-2 pm, i.e. near or at the end of the provisioning activities. The shift might be related to a need to thermoregulate following a prolonged period of time in warmer water. These changes could have fitness implications for individuals frequently visiting the provisioning site. Based on recorded amount of time spent in warm waters and published Q
835	33043980	Study on the relationships between molecular weights of chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides and Aβ-induced oxidative stress and the related mechanisms.	In the present study, we studied anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activities of chondroitin sulfate (CS) oligosaccharides with different molecular weights. CS from shark cartilage was degraded by a recombinant CS endolyase, chondroitinase ABC I (CHSase ABC I), and CS disaccharide (DP2), tetrasaccharide (DP4), hexasaccharide (DP6), octasaccharide (DP8), decasaccharide (DP10) and dodecasaccharide (DP12) were obtained by separation with gel filtration. Anti-AD activities of CS oligosaccharides were assessed using Aβ-injured SH-SY5Y cells and BV2 cells. It was shown that CS oligosaccharides could block Aβ-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway for SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, these activities increased with the increase of molecular weights. For Aβ-injured BV2 cells, CS oligosaccharides inhibited oxidative stress, the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of toll-like receptor pathway, and CS DP2 had the best activity among them. In conclusion, CS oligosaccharides suppressed Aβ-induced oxidative stress and relevant injury in vitro, and these effects had different relationships with the molecular weights of CS oligosaccharides for different cell lines, which might be caused by different mechanisms.
836	33034696	Nontraditional systems in aging research: an update.	Research on the evolutionary and mechanistic aspects of aging and longevity has a reductionist nature, as the majority of knowledge originates from experiments on a relatively small number of systems and species. Good examples are the studies on the cellular, molecular, and genetic attributes of aging (senescence) that are primarily based on a narrow group of somatic cells, especially fibroblasts. Research on aging and/or longevity at the organismal level is dominated, in turn, by experiments on Drosophila melanogaster, worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and higher organisms such as mice and humans. Other systems of aging, though numerous, constitute the minority. In this review, we collected and discussed a plethora of up-to-date findings about studies of aging, longevity, and sometimes even immortality in several valuable but less frequently used systems, including bacteria (Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli), invertebrates (Turritopsis dohrnii, Hydra sp., Arctica islandica), fishes (Nothobranchius sp., Greenland shark), reptiles (giant tortoise), mammals (blind mole rats, naked mole rats, bats, elephants, killer whale), and even 3D organoids, to prove that they offer biogerontologists as much as the more conventional tools. At the same time, the diversified knowledge gained owing to research on those species may help to reconsider aging from a broader perspective, which should translate into a better understanding of this tremendously complex and clearly system-specific phenomenon.
839	33027263	Assessing the reproductive biology of the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus).	The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus, Squaliformes: Somniosidae) is a long-lived Arctic top predator, which in combination with the high historical and modern fishing pressures, has made it subject to increased scientific focus in recent years. Key aspects of reproduction are not well known as exemplified by sparse and contradictory information e.g. on birth size and number of pups per pregnancy. This study represents the first comprehensive work on Greenland shark reproductive biology based on data from 312 specimens collected over the past 60 years. We provide guidelines quantifying reproductive parameters to assess specific maturation stages, as well as calculate body length-at-maturity (TL50) which was 2.84±0.06 m for males and 4.19±0.04 m for females. From the available information on the ovarian fecundity of Greenland sharks as well as a meta-analysis of Squaliform reproductive parameters, we estimate up to 200-324 pups per pregnancy (depending on maternal size) with a body length-at-birth of 35-45 cm. These estimates remain to be verified by future observations from gravid Greenland sharks.
840	33021503	Structure of CYRI-B (FAM49B), a key regulator of cellular actin assembly.	In eukaryotes, numerous fundamental processes are controlled by the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) that regulates cellular actin polymerization, crucial for cell motility, cell-cell adhesion and epithelial differentiation. Actin assembly is triggered by interaction of the small GTPase Rac1 with CYFIP1, a key component of the WRC. Previously known as FAM49B, CYRI-B is a protein that is highly conserved across the Eukaryota and has recently been revealed to be a key regulator of Rac1 activity. Mutation of CYRI-B or alteration of its expression therefore leads to altered actin nucleation dynamics, with impacts on lamellipodia formation, cell migration and infection by intracellular pathogens. In addition, knockdown of CYRI-B expression in cancer cell lines results in accelerated cell proliferation and invasiveness. Here, the structure of Rhincodon typus (whale shark) CYRI-B is presented, which is the first to be reported of any CYRI family member. Solved by X-ray crystallography, the structure reveals that CYRI-B comprises three distinct α-helical subdomains and is highly structurally related to a conserved domain present in CYFIP proteins. The work presented here establishes a template towards a better understanding of CYRI-B biological function.
841	33011039	A Blacktip Reef Shark Bite to the Hand in the Remote Solomon Islands.	"BACKGROUND: Solomon Islands is a country in the South Pacific Ocean with excellent scuba diving, particularly among its remote islands that can be accessed by liveaboard dive boats. Blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) are found throughout the island nation and rarely attack humans.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 42-year-old man who sustained a hand laceration after being bitten by a blacktip reef shark. He underwent complex primary wound closure in an austere environment and received prophylactic antibiotics. No infection developed and he recovered fully. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: We discuss our rationale in closing the wound aboard the dive boat, the choice of antibiotics, and review marine pathogens."
842	33006147	Anatomy of the mechanosensory lateral line canal system and electrosensory ampullae of Lorenzini in two species of sawshark (fam. Pristiophoridae).	It has long been assumed that the elongated rostra (the saws) of sawsharks (family: Pristiophoridae) and sawfish (family: Pristidae) serve a similar function. Recent behavioural and anatomical studies have shed light on the dual function of the pristid rostrum in mechanosensory and electrosensory prey detection and prey manipulation. Here, the authors examine the distributions of the mechanosensory lateral line canals and electrosensory ampullae of Lorenzini in the southern sawshark, Pristiophorus nudipinnis and the longnose sawshark, Pristiophorus cirratus. In both species, the receptive fields of the mechano- and electrosensory systems extend the full length of the rostrum indicating that the sawshark rostrum serves a sensory function. Interestingly, despite recent findings suggesting they feed at different trophic levels, minimal interspecific variation between the two species was recorded. Nonetheless, compared to pristids, the pristiophorid rostrum possesses a reduced mechanosensory sampling field but higher electrosensory resolution, which suggests that pristiophorids may not use their rostrums to disable large prey like pristids do.
843	33002022	Genetic connectivity of the scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini across Indonesia and the Western Indian Ocean.	Scalloped Hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) is an endangered species which its populations have been declining globally including in Indonesia, the world's top shark fishing country. However, there is a lack of information on the recent population structure of this species to promote proper management and its conservation status. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and connectivity of the S. lewini population, in three major shark landing sites: Aceh (n = 41), Balikpapan (n = 30), and Lombok (n = 29). Meanwhile, additional sequences were retrieved from West Papua (n = 14) and the Western Indian Ocean (n = 65) populations. From the analyses of the mitochondrial CO1 gene, a total of 179 sequences of S. lewini, with an average size of 594 bp, and 40 polymorphic loci in four and eight haplotypes for the Indonesian population and the Western Indian Ocean population were identified. The overall values of genetic diversity were high (h = 0.717; π = 0.013), with the highest values recorded in Aceh (h = 0.668; π = 0.002) and the lowest in Papua (h = 0.143; π = 0.000). On the contrary, the overall value was fairly low in the Western Indian Ocean (h = 0.232; π = 0.001). Furthermore, AMOVA and FST showed three significant subdivisions in Indonesia (FST = 0.442; P < 0.001), with separated populations for Aceh and West Papua, and mixed between Balikpapan and Lombok (FST = 0.044; P = 0.091). In contrast, genetic homogeneity was observed within the population of the Western Indian Ocean (FST = -0.013; P = 0.612). The establishment of a haplotype network provided evidence of a significantly different population and a limited genetic distribution between the Indonesian and the Western Indian Ocean populations (FST = 0.740; P < 0.001). This study showed the presence of a complex population of S. lewini with limited connectivity only in Indonesia separated from the Western Indian Ocean and requiring specific management measures based on the population structure at the regional level.
844	32989528	Excessive dynamic airway collapse during general anesthesia: a case report.	"BACKGROUND: Excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC) is an uncommon cause of high airway pressure during mechanical ventilation. However, EDAC is not widely recognized by anesthesiologists, and therefore, it is often misdiagnosed as asthma.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old woman with a history of asthma received anesthesia with sevoflurane for a laparotomic cholecystectomy. Under general anesthesia, she developed wheezing, high inspiratory pressure, and a shark-fin waveform on capnography, which was interpreted as an asthma attack. However, treatment with a bronchodilator was ineffective. Bronchoscopy revealed the collapse of the trachea and main bronchi upon expiration. We reviewed the preoperative computed tomography scan and saw bulging of the posterior membrane into the airway lumen, leading to a diagnosis of EDAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Although both EDAC and bronchospasm present as similar symptoms, the treatments are different. Bronchoscopy proved useful for distinguishing between these two entities. Positive end-expiratory pressure should be applied and bronchodilators avoided in EDAC."
845	32985701	First insights into the vertical habitat use of the whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari revealed by pop-up satellite archival tags.	The whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari is a tropical to warm-temperate benthopelagic batoid that ranges widely throughout the western Atlantic Ocean. Despite conservation concerns for the species, its vertical habitat use and diving behaviour remain unknown. Patterns and drivers in the depth distribution of A. narinari were investigated at two separate locations, the western North Atlantic (Islands of Bermuda) and the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Sarasota, Florida, U.S.A.). Between 2010 and 2014, seven pop-up satellite archival tags were attached to A. narinari using three methods: a through-tail suture, an external tail-band and through-wing attachment. Retention time ranged from 0 to 180 days, with tags attached via the through-tail method retained longest. Tagged rays spent the majority of time (82.85 ± 12.17% S.D.) within the upper 10 m of the water column and, with one exception, no rays travelled deeper than ~26 m. One Bermuda ray recorded a maximum depth of 50.5 m, suggesting that these animals make excursions off the fore-reef slope of the Bermuda Platform. Individuals occupied deeper depths (7.42 ± 3.99 m S.D.) during the day versus night (4.90 ± 2.89 m S.D.), which may be explained by foraging and/or predator avoidance. Each individual experienced a significant difference in depth and temperature distributions over the diel cycle. There was evidence that mean hourly depth was best described by location and individual variation using a generalized additive mixed model approach. This is the first study to compare depth distributions of A. narinari from different locations and describe the thermal habitat for this species. Our study highlights the importance of region in describing A. narinari depth use, which may be relevant when developing management plans, whilst demonstrating that diel patterns appear to hold across individuals.
846	32979434	The immunoglobulins of cartilaginous fishes.	Cartilaginous fishes, comprising the chimeras, sharks, skates, and rays, split from the common ancestor with other jawed vertebrates approx. 450 million years ago. Being the oldest extant taxonomic group to possess an immunoglobulin (Ig)-based adaptive immune system, examination of this group has taught us much about the evolution of adaptive immunity, as well as the conserved and taxon-specific characteristics of Igs. Significant progress has been made analyzing sequences from numerous genomic and transcriptomic data sets. These findings have been supported by additional functional studies characterizing the Igs and humoral response of sharks and their relatives. This review will summarize what we have learned about the genomic organization, protein structure, and in vivo function of these Ig isotypes in cartilaginous fishes and highlight the areas where our knowledge is still lacking.
847	32979336	Intrigue surrounding the life-cycles of species of Clistobothrium (Cestoda: Phyllobothriidea) parasitising large pelagic sharks.	This study aimed to locate the adults, and thus also the definitive hosts, of three species of marine mammal-parasitising larval cestodes that have molecular affinities with Clistobothrium. New collections led to the discovery of adults of two new species of Clistobothrium, one from the longfin mako shark and one from the salmon shark. New material of Clistobothrium tumidum was collected from the great white shark and new material of a previously reported undescribed species of Clistobothrium was collected from the porbeagle shark. Larvae of Clistobothrium were opportunistically collected from sockeye salmon and four species of small squaliform sharks. Sequence data for the D1-D3 region of the 28S rDNA gene were generated for all but one of these taxa. The tree resulting from maximum likelihood analysis of those data, in combination with comparable data from GenBank, indicates that squaliform sharks can serve as intermediate hosts for the species from the porbeagle shark. The larvae from salmon exhibit a unique molecular signature and, based on diet data, may be conspecific with adults from the salmon shark. Informed by sequence data for new material of Monorygma and existing data for Phyllobothrium, the larvae provisionally identified as Monorygma grimaldii and Phyllobothrium delphini were formally transferred to Clistobothrium. Especially puzzling was that the molecular signatures of none of the eight species of Clistobothrium match those of the three marine mammal-parasitising larval forms. We are at a loss as to where else to look for the three corresponding adult forms. The great white shark remains the most likely candidate given it consumes marine mammals with some regularity, but seems unlikely to host five species of Clistobothrium. Alternatively, we are left wondering if the large marine mammal predator Carcharocles megalodon may not be extinct after all.
848	32975738	Septitrema lichae n. g., n. sp. (Monogenea: Monocotylidae) from the nasal tissues of the deep-sea kitefin shark, Dalatias licha (Bonnaterre) (Squaliformes: Dalatiidae), off Algeria.	Septitrema lichae n. g., n. sp. (Monogenea: Monocotylidae: Merizocotylinae) is described from the nasal tissue of the deep-sea kitefin shark, Dalatias licha (Bonnaterre) (Dalatiidae) collected off Algiers, Algeria. The new genus is distinguished from the other genera in the subfamily by the number and arrangement of the loculi on the haptor having one central and seven peripheral loculi. The diagnosis of the Merizocotylinae is amended to accommodate this species and a key to the genera of the Merizocotylinae is provided. Terminology of the haptoral loculi in the Merizocotylinae and the status of some of the genera in the subfamily are also discussed.
849	32973707	Discovery of an Abundance of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in Shark Bay Microbial Mats.	Microbial mats are geobiological multilayered ecosystems that have significant evolutionary value in understanding the evolution of early life on Earth. Shark Bay, Australia has some of the best examples of modern microbial mats thriving under harsh conditions of high temperatures, salinity, desiccation, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Microorganisms living in extreme ecosystems are thought to potentially encode for secondary metabolites as a survival strategy. Many secondary metabolites are natural products encoded by a grouping of genes known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Natural products have diverse chemical structures and functions which provide competitive advantages for microorganisms and can also have biotechnology applications. In the present study, the diversity of BGC were described in detail for the first time from Shark Bay microbial mats. A total of 1477 BGCs were detected in metagenomic data over a 20 mm mat depth horizon, with the surface layer possessing over 200 BGCs and containing the highest relative abundance of BGCs of all mat layers. Terpene and bacteriocin BGCs were highly represented and their natural products are proposed to have important roles in ecosystem function in these mat systems. Interestingly, potentially novel BGCs were detected from Heimdallarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota, two evolutionarily significant archaeal phyla not previously known to possess BGCs. This study provides new insights into how secondary metabolites from BGCs may enable diverse microbial mat communities to adapt to extreme environments.
850	32972087	Facilitated NaCl Uptake in the Highly Developed Bundle of the Nephron in Japanese Red Stingray Hemitrygon akajei Revealed by Comparative Anatomy and Molecular Mapping.	Batoidea (rays and skates) is a monophyletic subgroup of elasmobranchs that diverged from the common ancestor with Selachii (sharks) about 270 Mya. A larger number of batoids can adapt to low-salinity environments, in contrast to sharks, which are mostly stenohaline marine species. Among osmoregulatory organs of elasmobranchs, the kidney is known to be dedicated to urea retention in ureosmotic cartilaginous fishes. However, we know little regarding urea reabsorbing mechanisms in the kidney of batoids. Here, we performed physiological and histological investigations on the nephrons in the red stingray (

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread around the world at an unprecedented rate. In the present study, 4 marine sulfated polysaccharides were screened for their inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2, including sea cucumber sulfated polysaccharide (SCSP), fucoidan from brown algae, iota-carrageenan from red algae, and chondroitin sulfate C from sharks (CS). Of them, SCSP, fucoidan, and carrageenan showed significant antiviral activities at concentrations of 3.90-500 μg mL-1. SCSP exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity with IC50 of 9.10 μg mL-1. Furthermore, a test using pseudotype virus with S glycoprotein confirmed that SCSP could bind to the S glycoprotein to prevent SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry. The three antiviral polysaccharides could be employed to treat and prevent COVID-19.
854	32965713	Comparative morphology of shark pectoral fins.	Sharks vary greatly in morphology, physiology, and ecology. Differences in whole body shape, swimming style, and physiological parameters have previously been linked to varied habitat uses. Pectoral fin morphology has been used to taxonomically classify species and hypotheses on the functional differences in shape are noted throughout the literature; however, there are limited comparative datasets that quantify external and skeletal morphology. Further, fins were previously categorized into two discrete groups based on the amount of skeletal support present: (a) aplesodic, where less than half of the fin is supported and (b) plesodic where greater than half of the fin is supported. These discrete classifications have been used to phylogenetically place species, though the methodology of classification is infrequently described. In this study, we sampled fins from 18 species, 6 families, and 3 orders, which were also grouped into five ecomorphotype classifications. We examined the external morphology, extent of skeletal support, and cross-sectional shape of individual cartilaginous elements. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that fin shape does not differ significantly between ecomorphotypes, suggesting there may be some mechanical constraint. However, we find that the internal anatomy of the fin does vary significantly between ecomorphotypes, especially the extent and distribution of calcification of skeletal support, suggesting that the superficial similarity of fin shapes across ecomorphotypes may belie differences in function. Finally, we find that a number of morphological variables such as number of radials, radial calcification and shape, and fin taper all correlate with the extent of skeletal support. Within these morphospaces, we also describe that some orders/families tend to occupy certain areas with limited overlap. While we demonstrate that there is some mechanical constraint limiting external variations in shark pectoral fin morphology, there are compounding differences in skeletal anatomy that occur within ecomorphotypes which we propose may affect function.
855	32961420	A scope at antifouling strategies to prevent catheter-associated infections.	The use of invasive medical devices is becoming more common nowadays, with catheters representing one of the most used medical devices. However, there is a risk of infection associated with the use of these devices, since they are made of materials that are prone to bacterial adhesion with biofilm formation, often requiring catheter removal as the only therapeutic option. Catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are among the most common causes of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) worldwide while endotracheal intubation is responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Therefore, to avoid the use of biocides due to the potential risk of bacterial resistance development, antifouling strategies aiming at the prevention of bacterial adherence and colonization of catheter surfaces represent important alternative measures. This review is focused on the main strategies that are able to modify the physical or chemical properties of biomaterials, leading to the creation of antiadhesive surfaces. The most promising approaches include coating the surfaces with hydrophilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(acrylamide) and poly(acrylates), betaine-based zwitterionic polymers and amphiphilic polymers or the use of bulk-modified poly(urethanes). Natural polysaccharides and its modifications with heparin, have also been used to improve hemocompatibility. Recently developed bioinspired techniques yielding very promising results in the prevention of bacterial adhesion and colonization of surfaces include slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) based on the superhydrophilic rim of the pitcher plant and the Sharklet topography inspired by the shark skin, which are potential candidates as surface-modifying approaches for biomedical devices. Concerning the potential application of most of these strategies in catheters, more in vivo studies and clinical trials are needed to assure their efficacy and safety for possible future use.
856	32958769	Over 90 endangered fish and invertebrates are caught in industrial fisheries.	Industrial-scale harvest of species at risk of extinction is controversial and usually highly regulated on land and for charismatic marine animals (e.g. whales). In contrast, threatened marine fish species can be legally caught in industrial fisheries. To determine the magnitude and extent of this problem, we analyze global fisheries catch and import data and find reported catch records of 91 globally threatened species. Thirteen of the species are traded internationally and predominantly consumed in European nations. Targeted industrial fishing for 73 of the threatened species accounts for nearly all (99%) of the threatened species catch volume and value. Our results are a conservative estimate of threatened species catch and trade because we only consider species-level data, excluding group records such as 'sharks and rays.' Given the development of new fisheries monitoring technologies and the current push for stronger international mechanisms for biodiversity management, industrial fishing of threatened fish and invertebrates should no longer be neglected in conservation and sustainability commitments.
857	32958671	Evolution of vertebrate gill covers via shifts in an ancient Pou3f3 enhancer.	Whereas the gill chambers of jawless vertebrates open directly into the environment, jawed vertebrates evolved skeletal appendages that drive oxygenated water unidirectionally over the gills. A major anatomical difference between the two jawed vertebrate lineages is the presence of a single large gill cover in bony fishes versus separate covers for each gill chamber in cartilaginous fishes. Here, we find that these divergent patterns correlate with the pharyngeal arch expression of Pou3f3 orthologs. We identify a deeply conserved Pou3f3 arch enhancer present in humans through sharks but undetectable in jawless fish. Minor differences between the bony and cartilaginous fish enhancers account for their restricted versus pan-arch expression patterns. In zebrafish, mutation of Pou3f3 or the conserved enhancer disrupts gill cover formation, whereas ectopic pan-arch Pou3f3b expression generates ectopic skeletal elements resembling the multimeric covers of cartilaginous fishes. Emergence of this Pou3f3 arch enhancer >430 Mya and subsequent modifications may thus have contributed to the acquisition and diversification of gill covers and respiratory strategies during gnathostome evolution.
858	32951197	Exclusive predation of sea turtle hatchlings by juvenile blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus at a turtle nesting site in Malaysia.	This study reports the discovery of the exclusive predation of sea turtle hatchlings by several juvenile blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) in Chagar Hutang bay on Redang Island, Malaysia, in the South China Sea. Three dead specimens of C. melanopterus were retrieved from ghost nets, and the entire digestive tracts of these sharks solely contained the partially digested bodies of sea turtle hatchlings, with no evidence of the remains of any other prey. Thus, juvenile C. melanopterus may opportunistically feed primarily on turtle hatchlings during times when hatchling abundance is high.
859	32949341	Neoalbionella izawai n. sp. from the smallfin gulper shark Centrophorus moluccensis Bleeker and additional host records for N. etmopteri (Yamaguti, 1939) off South Africa.	Neoalbionella Özdikmen, 2008 comprises 10 accepted species, which all infect sharks of Squaliformes and Carcharhiniformes. Adult females belonging to species of Neoalbionella, based on the maxillule palp armed with three setae and the maxilliped subchela claw with only one secondary denticle, were collected from sharks off the coast of South Africa. Neoalbionella izawai n. sp. collected from the anterodorsal part of the spiracle opening of Centrophorus moluccensis Bleeker differs from its congeners by having maxillae that are separated except at the tapering tips where they are fused and that are longer than the trunk, uropods originating from the pointed posterior margin of the trunk and that are well developed, and maxillipeds without an additional spine at the base of the subchela barb. Neoalbionella etmopteri (Yamaguti, 1939) is herein reported from two new hosts (Etmopterus spp.) off South Africa.
860	32944960	Sex differentiation in seasonal distribution of the starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias.	This mark-recapture study of starry smooth-hound Mustelus asterias tagged during the summer months near the Dutch coast demonstrates a large-scale spatial sex differentiation in their circannual migration patterns and small-scale spatial sex differentiation during summer. Overwintering occurs in the North Sea, English Channel and Bay of Biscay, with significantly more males in the Northern North Sea and more females in the Bay of Biscay. During summer, sheltered sea arms off the Dutch coast were almost exclusively used by adult females. In subsequent summers post-release, both sexes were mostly confined to the Southern North Sea, suggesting philopatry.
861	32938503	Microbial dark matter filling the niche in hypersaline microbial mats.	"BACKGROUND: Shark Bay, Australia, harbours one of the most extensive and diverse systems of living microbial mats that are proposed to be analogs of some of the earliest ecosystems on Earth. These ecosystems have been shown to possess a substantial abundance of uncultivable microorganisms. These enigmatic microbes, jointly coined as 'microbial dark matter' (MDM), are hypothesised to play key roles in modern microbial mats.
RESULTS: We reconstructed 115 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated to MDM, spanning 42 phyla. This study reports for the first time novel microorganisms (Zixibacterial order GN15) putatively taking part in dissimilatory sulfate reduction in surface hypersaline settings, as well as novel eukaryote signature proteins in the Asgard archaea. Despite possessing reduced-size genomes, the MDM MAGs are capable of fermenting and degrading organic carbon, suggesting a role in recycling organic carbon. Several forms of RuBisCo were identified, allowing putative CO

862	32935372	Description of the egg cases and juvenile colouration in two catsharks of the genus Atelomycterus (Carcharhiniformes: Scyliorhinidae).	Descriptions of egg cases and hatchlings of the Bali catshark Atelomycterus baliensis and the Australian marbled catshark Atelomycterus macleayi are provided. Comparisons are made with two of their congeners, banded sand catshark Atelomycterus fasciatus and coral catshark Atelomycterus marmoratus. The Atelomycterus egg cases have the same general morphology, i.e., elongate with anterior and posterior waists, a depressed and truncate anterior end sometimes with attachment fibres, a medially tapered posterior end with two horns sometimes terminating in short, tightly curled tendrils and four respiratory fissures (one at each left corner on opposing sides). Morphometric measurements taken of the egg cases of the four species differed significantly when subjected to multivariate analysis, with unique characters enabling distinction between them. The morphological characters that best distinguished the Atelomycterus species from each other were anterior border width, posterior waist width and posterior case width. Thus, egg case morphology could be used to distinguish the egg cases of the four Atelomycterus species examined, consistent with other studies on scyliorhinid and pentanchid egg cases. Colouration of A. baliensis and A. macleayi juveniles was similar to that of other Atelomycterus juveniles in being pale with a series of dark-brown distinct dorsal saddles along the body, blotches and sometimes with a low number of small dark spots.
864	32926128	Shark: fishing relevant reads in an RNA-Seq sample.	"MOTIVATION: Recent advances in high-throughput RNA-Seq technologies allow to produce massive datasets. When a study focuses only on a handful of genes, most reads are not relevant and degrade the performance of the tools used to analyze the data. Removing irrelevant reads from the input dataset leads to improved efficiency without compromising the results of the study.
RESULTS: We introduce a novel computational problem, called gene assignment and we propose an efficient alignment-free approach to solve it. Given an RNA-Seq sample and a panel of genes, a gene assignment consists in extracting from the sample, the reads that most probably were sequenced from those genes. The problem becomes more complicated when the sample exhibits evidence of novel alternative splicing events. We implemented our approach in a tool called Shark and assessed its effectiveness in speeding up differential splicing analysis pipelines. This evaluation shows that Shark is able to significantly improve the performance of RNA-Seq analysis tools without having any impact on the final results.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The tool is distributed as a stand-alone module and the software is freely available at https://github.com/AlgoLab/shark.

865	32925094	Squalamine Restores the Function of the Enteric Nervous System in Mouse Models of Parkinson's Disease.	"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder thought to be caused by accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) within the brain, autonomic nerves, and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Involvement of the ENS in PD often precedes the onset of the classic motor signs of PD by many years at a time when severe constipation represents a major morbidity. Studies conducted in vitro and in vivo, have shown that squalamine, a zwitterionic amphipathic aminosterol, originally isolated from the liver of the dogfish shark, effectively displaces membrane-bound α-syn.
OBJECTIVE: Here we explore the electrophysiological effect of squalamine on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of mouse models of PD engineered to express the highly aggregating A53T human α-syn mutant.
METHODS: GI motility and in vivo response to oral squalamine in PD model mice and controls were assessed using an in vitro tissue motility protocol and via fecal pellet output. Vagal afferent response to squalamine was measured using extracellular mesenteric nerve recordings from the jejunum. Whole cell patch clamp was performed to measure response to squalamine in the myenteric plexus.
RESULTS: Squalamine effectively restores disordered colonic motility in vivo and within minutes of local application to the bowel. We show that topical squalamine exposure to intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) of the ENS rapidly restores excitability.
CONCLUSION: These observations may help to explain how squalamine may promote gut propulsive activity through local effects on IPANs in the ENS, and further support its possible utility in the treatment of constipation in patients with PD."
866	32920886	An estimate of the number of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias interacting with ecotourism in Guadalupe Island.	The aim of the present study is to provide an estimate of the number of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias that seasonally interact with ecotourism boats in Guadalupe Island using Schnabel's mark-recapture method and 6316 records of white sharks during 2012-2014. The results of the estimation highlight an abundance of 78 white sharks 95% C.I. (62.1, 105.6) interacting with ecotourism. The regulations regarding the number of tourists, boats and the monitoring of white sharks should be assessed to improve management decisions regarding the conservation and sustainable use of this threatened species.
867	32920858	Re-evaluation of reproductive cycle and fecundity of finetooth sharks Carcharhinus isodon (Valenciennes 1839) from the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, with new observations on ovarian cycle and reproductive endocrinology of biennially reproducing sharks.	To provide updated information on life history for improved fishery management, the reproductive cycle of the finetooth shark Carcharhinus isodon from Northwest Atlantic (NWA) populations was investigated by examining temporal changes in morphology and histology of reproductive organs. Changes in plasma concentrations of gonadal sex hormones in relation to reproductive stage were also examined. Increases in testis width, epididymis head width, plasma testosterone concentrations and occurrence of mature spermatozoa were observed in male sharks between December and April, suggesting a seasonal pattern in reproduction that culminates with copulatory activity in May. Increases in maximum follicular diameter, oviducal gland width, plasma 17β-estradiol concentrations and occurrence of vitellogenic follicles were observed in non-pregnant female sharks during the same time period along with the occurrence of newly pregnant females in May, demonstrating strong synchronicity between male and female reproductive cycles. Pregnant females bearing full-term embryos were also observed in May, indicating that parturition occurs between mid-May and early June and gestation requires 12 months. Only transient temporal changes in follicle size and oviducal gland width were observed in pregnant females, indicating that reproductive periodicity is biennial; nonetheless, a single female exhibiting signs of concurrent vitellogenesis and pregnancy was observed. Mean brood size ± S.D. was 3.9 ± 0.9 offspring/female. Fecundity was not significantly correlated with female size, in part due to an unexpectedly high rate of early embryo mortality, which occurred in 11% of pregnant females, and was more common in larger individuals. Changes in ovarian activity during mid-pregnancy were observed, suggesting possible roles for the ovary in regulating some aspects of early to mid-gestation. This study confirms that earlier characterizations of the reproductive cycle and fecundity in NWA finetooth sharks remain valid for use in fishery management. This study also highlights unusual features of finetooth shark pregnancy (e.g., early embryo death, mid-pregnancy changes in ovarian function) that may have broader relevance to understanding elasmobranch reproduction.
868	35516835	The Baby Shark (Songs Heard Affecting Resuscitation Kinetics) study.	Previous research has examined the utilisation of musical cues to improve the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) delivered in training environments. We postulated a musical cue that is both contemporary and transcends cultures may improve CPR performance. Our aim was to establish whether chest compressions are performed with improved rate and depth if a song of a fixed beat (PinkFong's 'Baby Shark' with a tempo of 115 beats per minute (bpm) and 15 beats in each verse) is played to a healthcare professional immediately before undertaking CPR compared to whale noises (a non-metronomic rhythm). 58 Participants of a paediatric conference (majority doctors) were randomly assigned to listen to a minute of Baby Shark (28) or whale song (30) and then undertake a minute of CPR. There was no significant difference in the mean compression rate between the Baby Shark and control groups, with the groups achieving 121 and 125 bpm, respectively (p=0.18). In relation to compression depth within the target zone, the Baby Shark group had more compressions completed within the target zone (55%) than the control group (39%) although this difference was not significant (p=0.08). Listening to Baby Shark prior to undertaking simulated CPR does not improve overall performance, but there is a potential tendency to improve adequate compression depth which may be beneficial in training exercises.
869	32915423	A first observation of spermatogenesis in mature male scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini) from Zinkwazi, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.	Sharks are not only threatened, but also have a low fecundity as they are being overfished. The shark family, Sphyrnidae, consists of nine species of which three are found in South African oceans. One of the three Sphyrnidae species, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) are the most common, but their biology and mode of reproduction are not extensively studied in terms of their reproductive biology. The aim of this study was to describe the germ cell development in the testes of sexually mature male scalloped hammerheads. Three individual male S. lewini were caught at Zinkwazi, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The sharks and their reproductive organs were weighed and measured to collect the biometric data for the condition factor and the gonado-somatic index. Following standard necropsy, the testes were fixed in Bouin's solution and processed for histological assessment. The histological assessment revealed that the testes of S. lewini consist of seminiferous tubules which form part of a larger lobular structure with germ cells in different stages of development, from spermatogonia to mature spermatozoa. Seven stages of development were identified during the process of spermatogenesis, similar to what has been described for elasmobranchs. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the testes of S. lewini are diametrical and polyspermatocystic and conforms to the testes structure of elasmobranch males.
870	32914448	Reproductive cycle and fecundity of the bonnethead Sphyrna tiburo L. from the northwest Atlantic Ocean.	The present study examined temporal changes in plasma sex hormone concentrations and the morphology and histology of reproductive organs in mature northwest Atlantic (NWA) bonnetheads Sphyrna tiburo L. to characterize reproductive cycle, breeding periodicity and fertility in this still poorly studied population. Progressive increases in testis width, epididymis head width, plasma testosterone (T) concentrations, and occurrence of mature spermatozoa were observed in male S. tiburo from June to September, demonstrating that spermatogenesis occurs during the summer. Nonetheless, increases in maximum follicle diameter, oviducal gland width, plasma 17β-estradiol and T concentrations, and occurrence of vitellogenic follicles were not observed in mature females until between October and April, demonstrating non-synchronous patterns of gametogenesis in males and females. Fresh copulatory wounds were observed in females collected during late September along with histological evidence for sperm presence in the oviducal gland between September and April, confirming a 6- to 7 month period of female sperm storage. Ovulation occurred between mid-April and early May in concert with increases in female plasma progesterone concentrations. Gestation occurred during a 4.5- to 5 month period between May and early September, and 97% of mature females collected during this period were gravid, indicating a highly synchronized, annual reproductive periodicity. Brood size was significantly correlated with maternal size and ranged from 1 to 13 pups with a mean ± S.D. of 8.1 ± 2.2, which was significantly lower than reported in Gulf of Mexico (GOM) populations. The occurrence of non-fertile offspring was observed in 17% of broods with a range of 1-7 non-fertile eggs present in individual females. Thus, as previously reported in GOM S. tiburo, this unusual form of infertility also appears to be prevalent in the NWA population and requires further study. This study has demonstrated meaningful differences in reproductive biology of these populations, emphasizing the need for region-specific approaches for population management.
871	32907736	Marine protected areas for demersal elasmobranchs in highly exploited Mediterranean ecosystems.	Marine ecosystems are complex socio-ecological systems where sustainable solutions can be best gained by satisfying both conservation and socioeconomic demands. Concretely, the Mediterranean Sea is facing a huge demand of resources and marine activities while hosting abundant and unique biodiversity. It is considered an important elasmobranch hotspot where seventy-two elasmobranch species are present in the basin. Despite the recognised importance of elasmobranchs as umbrella species, to date only a small number of marine protected areas have been designated towards their protection. The paucity of spatially-explicit abundance data on elasmobranchs often precludes the designation of these areas to protect these marine predators. Here, we aimed to identify marine areas to protect elasmobranch species by means of a systematic spatial planning approach. We first estimated the spatial distribution of five elasmobranch species (three sharks and two rays) in the western Mediterranean Sea and then applied Marxan decision support tools to find priority marine conservation areas. We found that the five elasmobranchs are distributed in coastal and slope areas of the southern waters of the study area while in the northern region they are abundant in the continental slope and towards offshore waters. Conservation priority areas were identified in the southern part of the western Mediterranean. Adding more complex cost layers and zoning to the analysis did not alter conservation priority areas, confirming such areas are highly consistent and highly important for elasmobranch protection. The marine conservation priority areas identified here can contribute to designate a proactive area-based protection strategy towards elasmobranch conservation, related species and the habitats that they depend in the western Mediterranean Sea.
872	32907560	Novel developmental bases for the evolution of hypobranchial muscles in vertebrates.	"BACKGROUND: Vertebrates are characterized by possession of hypobranchial muscles (HBMs). Cyclostomes, or modern jawless vertebrates, possess a rudimentary and superficial HBM lateral to the pharynx, whereas the HBM in jawed vertebrates is internalized and anteroposteriorly specified. Precursor cells of the HBM, marked by expression of Lbx1, originate from somites and undergo extensive migration before becoming innervated by the hypoglossal nerve. How the complex form of HBM arose in evolution is relevant to the establishment of the vertebrate body plan, but despite having long been assumed to be similar to that of limb muscles, modification of developmental mechanisms of HBM remains enigmatic.
RESULTS: Here we characterize the expression of Lbx genes in lamprey and hagfish (cyclostomes) and catshark (gnathostome; jawed vertebrates). We show that the expression patterns of the single cyclostome Lbx homologue, Lbx-A, do not resemble the somitic expression of mammalian Lbx1. Disruption of Lbx-A revealed that LjLbx-A is required for the formation of both HBM and body wall muscles, likely due to the insufficient extension of precursor cells rather than to hindered muscle differentiation. Both homologues of Lbx in the catshark were expressed in the somitic muscle primordia, unlike in amniotes. During catshark embryogenesis, Lbx2 is expressed in the caudal HBM as well as in the abdominal rectus muscle, similar to lamprey Lbx-A, whereas Lbx1 marks the rostral HBM and pectoral fin muscle.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the vertebrate HBM primarily emerged as a specialized somatic muscle to cover the pharynx, and the anterior internalized HBM of the gnathostomes is likely a novelty added rostral to the cyclostome-like HBM, for which duplication and functionalization of Lbx genes would have been a prerequisite."
873	32904346	Variation in reproductive effort, genetic diversity and mating systems across Posidonia australis seagrass meadows in Western Australia.	Populations at the edges of their geographical range tend to have lower genetic diversity, smaller effective population sizes and limited connectivity relative to centre of range populations. Range edge populations are also likely to be better adapted to more extreme conditions for future survival and resilience in warming environments. However, they may also be most at risk of extinction from changing climate. We compare reproductive and genetic data of the temperate seagrass, 
875	32897540	Social media posts reveal the geographic range of the Critically Endangered clown wedgefish, Rhynchobatus cooki.	The shark-like rays of the family Rhinidae (wedgefishes) are globally threatened with extinction. The poorly known clown wedgefish, Rhynchobatus cooki has historically been recorded only from fish markets in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia. Its natural geographic range has until now gone undocumented. Social media posts revealed the first wild records of this Critically Endangered species; six records were located between 2015 and 2020 from small-scale fisheries in Lingga and Singkep Islands, Indonesia. These results demonstrate the utility of social media searches to identify biogeographic records of cryptic and data-poor species.
876	32896007	Histologic Observations of Dermal Wound Healing in a Free-Ranging Blacktip Shark from the Southeastern U.S. Atlantic Coast: A Case Report.	Despite indications that sharks have an exceptional capacity to heal from traumatic injuries, no detailed microscopic observations of integumental wounds have been reported for sharks. This study details the histopathological features of such wounds in a free-ranging shark. An adult male Blacktip Shark Carcharhinus limbatus was collected in 2017 during fisheries-independent sampling efforts in the coastal southeastern U.S. Atlantic. The shark had numerous lesions on his head, torso, and left pectoral fin that were compatible with shark bites. Representative samples from two wounds on the head were examined by light microscopy. The epidermal changes included hyperplasia and hypertrophy; intracellular edema; and the absence of goblet cells, denticles, and chromatophores. In the dermis, fibrinocellular exudation, granulation tissue, and marked skeletal muscle necrosis and regeneration were observed. The above features were comparable to wound healing in bony fish, albeit minor differences were found. Although this case documents exceptionally good regeneration of skeletal muscle in the shark, we found no evidence of unique morphological healing patterns. Further studies on wound healing are needed because recent molecular and genetic findings do suggest evolutionary adaptations enhancing healing in sharks.
877	32895518	Endochondral bone in an Early Devonian 'placoderm' from Mongolia.	Endochondral bone is the main internal skeletal tissue of nearly all osteichthyans-the group comprising more than 60,000 living species of bony fishes and tetrapods. Chondrichthyans (sharks and their kin) are the living sister group of osteichthyans and have primarily cartilaginous endoskeletons, long considered the ancestral condition for all jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). The absence of bone in modern jawless fishes and the absence of endochondral ossification in early fossil gnathostomes appear to lend support to this conclusion. Here we report the discovery of extensive endochondral bone in Minjinia turgenensis, a new genus and species of 'placoderm'-like fish from the Early Devonian (Pragian) of western Mongolia described using X-ray computed microtomography. The fossil consists of a partial skull roof and braincase with anatomical details providing strong evidence of placement in the gnathostome stem group. However, its endochondral space is filled with an extensive network of fine trabeculae resembling the endochondral bone of osteichthyans. Phylogenetic analyses place this new taxon as a proximate sister group of the gnathostome crown. These results provide direct support for theories of generalized bone loss in chondrichthyans. Furthermore, they revive theories of a phylogenetically deeper origin of endochondral bone and its absence in chondrichthyans as a secondary condition.
878	32892380	Aspects of the reproductive biology of two pelagic sharks in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.	This study used data provided by the Chinese Longline Fishery Scientific Observer Programme from the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean to estimate the reproductive parameters of the blue shark (Prionace glauca) and crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai). Sizes ranged from 80 to 298 cm fork length (FL) for blue sharks and from 48 to 99 cm FL for crocodile sharks. Sexual segregation was observed during different months for both sharks. The sex ratio for blue sharks was 1.38 F:1 M, and 1 F:2.79 M for crocodile sharks. The size of adult blue sharks ranged from 144 to 280 cm for males and from 174 to 298 cm for females; and that of crocodile sharks from 63 to 97 cm for males and 78-99 cm for females. The size at 50% of maturity for blue sharks was estimated at 191.7 cm FL for females and 197.5 cm FL for males, and that of crocodile sharks was assessed at 84.9 cm FL for females and 78.5 cm FL for males. Most sexually matured females were pregnant; their means were 207.2 ± 16.4 cm FL for blue sharks and 89.4 ± 4.3 cm FL for crocodile sharks. Mature sizes for both species were significantly different among months. Embryonic sizes also varied widely among months for crocodile sharks, but a slight change was recorded for those of blue sharks. The observed mean size at birth and litter size were 34.5 cm FL and 37 ± 12 for the blue sharks, and that of the crocodile sharks, 39.5 cm FL and a dominant four embryos in the uterus. Due to the observed increasing catch trend of blue sharks and the slow reproductive cycle of crocodile sharks, this study presents the need of implementing conservation measures to ensure the sustainability of both species in their habitat.
879	32890699	Comparative eye and liver differentially expressed genes reveal monochromatic vision and cancer resistance in the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus).	The shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus is an oceanic pelagic shark found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters. However, the understanding of its biology at molecular level is still incipient. We sequenced the messenger RNA isolated from eye and liver tissues. De novo transcriptome yielded a total of 705,940 transcripts. A total of 3774 genes were differentially expressed (DEGs), with 1612 in the eye and 2162 in the liver. Most DEGs in the eye were related to structural and signaling functions, including nonocular and ocular opsin genes, whereas nine out of ten most overexpressed genes in the liver were related to tumor suppression, wound healing, and human diseases. Furthermore, DEGs findings provide insights on the monochromatic shark vision and a repertory of cancer-related genes, which may be insightful to elucidate shark resistance to cancer. Therefore, our results provide valuable sequence resources for future functional and population studies.
880	32885216	Implementation and sustainment of diverse practices in a large integrated health system: a mixed methods study.	"BACKGROUND: One goal of health systems seeking to evolve into learning health systems is to accelerate the implementation and sustainment of evidence-based practices (EBPs). As part of this evolution, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) developed the Innovation Ecosystem, which includes the Diffusion of Excellence (DoE), a program that identifies and diffuses Gold Status Practices (GSPs) across facilities. The DoE hosts an annual ""Shark Tank"" competition in which leaders bid on the opportunity to implement a GSP with 6 months of implementation support. Over 750 diverse practices were submitted in cohorts 2 and 3 of Shark Tank; 23 were designated GSPs and were implemented in 31 VA networks or facilities. As part of a national evaluation of the DoE, we identified factors contributing to GSP implementation and sustainment.
METHODS: Our sequential mixed methods evaluation of cohorts 2 and 3 of Shark Tank included semi-structured interviews with at least one representative from 30/31 implementing teams (
RESULTS: Over 50% of teams (17/30) successfully implemented their GSP within the 6-month implementation period. Despite extensive implementation support, significant barriers related to centralized decision-making, staffing, and resources led to partial (
CONCLUSIONS: Most teams implemented within 6 months and/or sustained their GSP 1.5 years later. High levels of implementation and sustainment across diverse practices and teams suggest that VHA's DoE is a successful large-scale model of diffusion. Team predictions about sustainability after the first 6 months of implementation provide a promising early assessment and point of intervention to increase sustainability."
881	32884037	Early vertebrate origin of CTCFL, a CTCF paralog, revealed by proximity-guided shark genome scaffolding.	The nuclear protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) contributes as an insulator to chromatin organization in diverse animals. The gene encoding this protein has a paralog which was first identified to be expressed exclusively in the testis in mammals and designated as CTCFL (also called BORIS). CTCFL orthologs were reported only among amniotes, and thus CTCFL was once thought to have arisen in the amniote lineage. In this study, we identified elasmobranch CTCFL orthologs, and investigated its origin with the aid of a shark genome assembly improved by proximity-guided scaffolding. Our analysis employing evolutionary interpretation of syntenic gene location suggested an earlier timing of the gene duplication between CTCF and CTCFL than previously thought, that is, around the common ancestor of extant vertebrates. Also, our transcriptomic sequencing revealed a biased expression of the catshark CTCFL in the testis, suggesting the origin of the tissue-specific localization in mammals more than 400 million years ago. To understand the historical process of the functional consolidation of the long-standing chromatin regulator CTCF, its additional paralogs remaining in some of the descendant lineages for spatially restricted transcript distribution should be taken into consideration.
882	32883981	Body dimensions of the extinct giant shark Otodus megalodon: a 2D reconstruction.	Inferring the size of extinct animals is fraught with danger, especially when they were much larger than their modern relatives. Such extrapolations are particularly risky when allometry is present. The extinct giant shark †Otodus megalodon is known almost exclusively from fossilised teeth. Estimates of †O. megalodon body size have been made from its teeth, using the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) as the only modern analogue. This can be problematic as the two species likely belong to different families, and the position of the †Otodus lineage within Lamniformes is unclear. Here, we infer †O. megalodon body dimensions based on anatomical measurements of five ecologically and physiologically similar extant lamniforms: Carcharodon carcharias, Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna ditropis and Lamna nasus. We first assessed for allometry in all analogues using linear regressions and geometric morphometric analyses. Finding no evidence of allometry, we made morphological extrapolations to infer body dimensions of †O. megalodon at different sizes. Our results suggest that a 16 m †O. megalodon likely had a head ~ 4.65 m long, a dorsal fin ~ 1.62 m tall and a tail ~ 3.85 m high. Morphometric analyses further suggest that its dorsal and caudal fins were adapted for swift predatory locomotion and long-swimming periods.
883	32879428	A hydrodynamics assessment of the hammerhead shark cephalofoil.	Hammerhead sharks are characterized by a conspicuous lateral expansion of the head forming a structure known as a cephalofoil. Two theories regarding the function of this structure suggest that it may increase maneuverability as well as produce dynamic lift similar to a cambered airplane wing. Here we report on a family-wide computational fluid dynamics analysis of all eight hammerhead shark species and three sharks with typical head shape. Models cast of the heads of fresh and museum specimens of hammerhead and typical sharks were used to produce pressure surface maps and lift and drag polar diagrams at various angles of attack. These analyses suggested that the cephalofoil (1) provides greater maneuverability that may be important in prey capture efficacy, (2) does not provide significant dynamic lift when held parallel to flow, (3) is characterized by greater drag than typical sharks across all attack angles, and (4) was found to result in a 10-x increase in energetic cost over typical shark head morphologies.
884	32877404	Artificial habitats host elevated densities of large reef-associated predators.	Large predators play important ecological roles, yet many are disproportionately imperiled. In marine systems, artificial reefs are often deployed to restore degraded reefs or supplement existing reefs, but it remains unknown whether these interventions benefit large predators. Comparative field surveys of thirty artificial and natural reefs across ~200 km of the North Carolina, USA coast revealed large reef-associated predators were more dense on artificial than natural reefs. This pattern was associated with higher densities of transient predators (e.g. jacks, mackerel, barracuda, sharks) on artificial reefs, but not of resident predators (e.g., grouper, snapper). Further analyses revealed that this pattern of higher transient predator densities on artificial reefs related to reef morphology, as artificial reefs composed of ships hosted higher transient predator densities than concrete reefs. The strength of the positive association between artificial reefs and transient predators increased with a fundamental habitat trait-vertical extent. Taller artificial reefs had higher densities of transient predators, even when accounting for habitat area. A global literature review of high trophic level fishes on artificial and natural habitats suggests that the overall pattern of more predators on artificial habitats is generalizable. Together, these findings provide evidence that artificial habitats, especially those like sunken ships that provide high vertical structure, may support large predators.
885	32872285	Determining the Authenticity of Shark Meat Products by DNA Sequencing.	Given that the global shark meat market is poised to grow in future years, the aim of this study was to use DNA sequencing of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (NADH2) mitochondrial genes to examine the market of shark meat products in Italy. This made it possible to analyze patterns of species utilization and commercialization of threatened, endangered and/or prohibited species, focusing on fraudulent activities in the shark food chain in order to propose seafood safety and environmental sustainability solutions. The study shows that the labeling of shark meat products generally lacks comprehensive information, thus making it difficult for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and fails to comply with European Union (EU) legislation regarding seafood labelling. Molecular investigation reveals a high mislabeling rate (45.4%), highlighting widespread use of cheaper species either in order to replace species that are better known and more popular, or else in order to sell various threatened species. Considering that seafood mislabeling can circumvent the management of sustainable fisheries and facilitate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, the routine use of genetic analysis should be encouraged among control and enforcement agencies in order to implement effective management measures. This would help to build a species-specific reporting system for all catches, and enhance control measures, in order to prevent illegal activities connected with shark catches and trade around the world.
886	32870419	Volumetric analysis and morphological assessment of the ascending olfactory pathway in an elasmobranch and a teleost using diceCT.	The size (volume or mass) of the olfactory bulbs in relation to the whole brain has been used as a neuroanatomical proxy for olfactory capability in a range of vertebrates, including fishes. Here, we use diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) to test the value of this novel bioimaging technique for generating accurate measurements of the relative volume of the main olfactory brain areas (olfactory bulbs, peduncles, and telencephalon) and to describe the morphological organisation of the ascending olfactory pathway in model fish species from two taxa, the brownbanded bamboo shark Chiloscyllium punctatum and the common goldfish Carassius auratus. We also describe the arrangement of primary projections to the olfactory bulb and secondary projections to the telencephalon in both species. Our results identified substantially larger olfactory bulbs and telencephalon in C. punctatum compared to C. auratus (comprising approximately 5.2% vs. 1.8%, and 51.8% vs. 11.8% of the total brain volume, respectively), reflecting differences between taxa, but also possibly in the role of olfaction in the sensory ecology of these species. We identified segregated primary projections to the bulbs, associated with a compartmentalised olfactory bulb in C. punctatum, which supports previous findings in elasmobranch fishes. DiceCT imaging has been crucial for visualising differences in the morphological organisation of the olfactory system of both model species. We consider comparative neuroanatomical studies between representative species of both elasmobranch and teleost fish groups are fundamental to further our understanding of the evolution of the olfactory system in early vertebrates and the neural basis of olfactory abilities.
887	32866206	Shark discards in selective and mixed-species pelagic longline fisheries.	The conservation status of several pelagic shark species is considered vulnerable with declining populations, yet data on shark fishing mortality remain limited for large ocean regions. Pelagic sharks are increasingly retained by mixed-species fisheries, or are discarded and not reported by selective fisheries for tunas (Thunnus spp.) or swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We estimated the fishing mortality of sharks (landings plus discard mortalities) in a South African-flagged pelagic longline fishery with diverse targeting and discard behaviour. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to stratify the fleet according to the relative proportions of tunas, swordfish, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) landed by individual vessels between 2013 and 2015. A spatial analysis of logbook data indicated that subfleets operated in distinct fishing areas, with overlap. Approximately 5% of all commercial longlines set during 2015 were sampled by a fisheries-independent observer, and the species, discard ratios and physical condition at discard of 6 019 captured sharks were recorded. Blue sharks and shortfin makos dominated observed shark catches, which were comprised of nine species and two species groups. Some 47% of observed sharks were retained and 20% were discarded in good physical condition. Only 4% of shortfin makos were discarded, compared to 68% of blue sharks. Blue shark discard mortality rates were twice as high as published at-vessel mortality rates, suggesting that onboard handling, among other factors, contributed to discard mortalities. Extrapolation to total fishing effort indicated a near 10-fold increase in blue shark and shortfin mako fishing mortality compared to an earlier study (1998-2005). Escalating shortfin mako fishing mortality was attributed to increased targeting to supply higher market demand. Discarding of blue sharks by selective fishing for tunas and swordfish had a greater impact on their fishing mortality than retention by shark-directed fleets. Higher levels of observer sampling are required to increase confidence in discard ratio estimates.
888	32865634	Analysis of Trace Element Concentrations and Antioxidant Enzyme Activity in Muscle Tissue of the Atlantic Sharpnose Shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae.	Metals occur naturally in the environment; however, anthropogenic practices have greatly increased metal concentrations in waterways, sediments, and biota. Metals pose health risks to marine organisms and have been associated with oxidative stress, which can lead to protein denaturation, DNA mutations, and cellular apoptosis. Sharks are important species ecologically, recreationally, and commercially. Because they occupy a high trophic level, assessing muscle tissue metal concentrations in sharks may reflect metal transfer in marine food webs. In this study, concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc were measured in the muscle of Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Atlantic sharpnose shark) from 12 sites along the coast of the southeastern United States. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) also were examined in the muscle tissue of R. terraenovae. A total of 165 samples were analyzed, and differences in trace element bioaccumulation and enzyme activity were observed across sites. R. terraenovae samples collected from South Florida and South Carolina had the highest cumulative trace element concentrations whereas those collected from North Carolina and Alabama had the lowest cumulative concentrations. Trace element concentrations in shark muscle tissue were significantly correlated to antioxidant enzyme activity, particularly with glutathione peroxidase, suggesting that this enzyme may serve as a non-lethal, biomarker of metal exposure in R. terraenovae. This is one of the most extensive studies providing reference levels of trace elements and oxidative stress enzymes in a single elasmobranch species within the U.S.

890	32811304	Global change in the functional diversity of marine fisheries exploitation over the past 65 years.	Overexploitation is recognized as one of the main threats to global biodiversity. Here, we report a widespread change in the functional diversity of fisheries catches from the large marine ecosystems (LMEs) of the world over the past 65 years (1950 to 2014). The spatial and temporal trends of functional diversity exploited from the LMEs were calculated using global reconstructed marine fisheries catch data provided by the Sea Around Us initiative (including subsistence, artisanal, recreational, industrial fisheries, and discards) and functional trait data available in FishBase. Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80% of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75% of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected. These trends show that global fisheries are increasingly targeting species that play diverse roles within the marine ecosystem and underline the importance of incorporating functional diversity in ecosystem management.
891	32810535	Structural characterization and proliferation activity of chondroitin sulfate from the sturgeon, Acipenser schrenckii.	The cartilages of marine fish, such as sharks and sturgeon, are important resources of the bioactive chondroitin sulfate (CS). To explore glycosaminoglycans from marine fish, polysaccharides from the cartilage of the sturgeon, Acipenser schrenckii, were extracted. Using enzyme-assisted extraction and anion-exchange chromatography, an uronic acid-containing polysaccharide, YG-1, was isolated. YG-1 is composed of GlcN, GlcUA, GalN, and Gal, in the ratio of 1.4: 3.4: 3.7: 1.0, and its molecular weight was determined to be 3.0 × 10
893	32794219	Habitat suitability of Rhincodon typus in three localities of the Gulf of California: Environmental drivers of seasonal aggregations.	The whale shark is an endangered species that usually feeds in coastal areas of highly productive seas such as the Gulf of California, Mexico. This study aims to describe the effect of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, bathymetry and slope on the habitat suitability of whale sharks in three important aggregation sites of the Gulf of California. A total of 2396 records of occurrence of whale sharks were obtained from international databases and scientific literature between 1996 and 2018. These records were used for the creation of a species distribution model using MaxEnt for each of the three aggregation sites. The concentration of chlorophyll a explained 71% of the habitat suitability, followed by bathymetry and slope with a combined 17%, and sea surface temperature constituting 10% of the model. Habitat suitability was related to areas where nontargeted fisheries may impact whale sharks through bycatch, entanglement and ship strikes. The implications for the conservation of whale sharks should be considered for management decisions in terms of marine protected areas, fishing refugees or bans, and other regulations regarding fisheries activities.
894	32792058	Viviparity in the longest-living vertebrate, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus).	"BACKGROUND: The Greenland shark is renowned for its great longevity, yet little is known about its reproduction.
METHODS: We supplemented the sparse information on this species by extrapolation from observations on other members of the sleeper shark family and the order Squaliformes.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The Greenland shark is viviparous and a single observation suggests a litter size of about ten. The gestation period is unknown, but embryos reach a length of around 40 cm at birth. Nutrition is derived from the yolk sac with minimal histotrophy. The surface area of the uterus is increased by villi that presumably increase in length with advancing gestation. These villi are not likely to be secretory but play a key role in the oxygen supply to the embryo. We argue that the ability of the uterus to supply oxygen is a limiting factor for litter size, which is not likely to exceed the small number reported in this and other sleeper sharks."
895	32791054	Development and regeneration of the crushing dentition in skates (Rajidae).	Sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) have the remarkable capacity to continuously regenerate their teeth. The polyphyodont system is considered the ancestral condition of the gnathostome dentition. Despite this shared regenerative ability, sharks and rays exhibit dramatic interspecific variation in their tooth morphology. Ray (batoidea) teeth typically constitute crushing pads of flattened teeth, whereas shark teeth are pointed, multi-cuspid units. Although recent research has addressed the molecular development of the shark dentition, little is known about that of the ray. Furthermore, how dental diversity within the elasmobranch lineage is achieved remains unknown. Here, we examine dental development and regeneration in two Batoid species: the thornback skate (Raja clavata) and the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we examine the expression of a core gnathostome dental gene set during early development of the skate dentition and compare it to development in the shark. Elasmobranch tooth development is highly conserved, with sox2 likely playing an important role in the initiation and regeneration of teeth. Alterations to conserved genes expressed in an enamel knot-like signalling centre may explain the morphological diversity of elasmobranch teeth, thereby enabling sharks and rays to occupy diverse dietary and ecological niches.
896	32783522	Multiyear social stability and social information use in reef sharks with diel fission-fusion dynamics.	Animals across vertebrate taxa form social communities and often exist as fission-fusion groups. Central place foragers (CPF) may form groups from which they will predictably disperse to forage, either individually or in smaller groups, before returning to fuse with the larger group. However, the function and stability of social associations in predatory fish acting as CPFs is unknown, as individuals do not need to return to a shelter yet show fidelity to core areas. Using dynamic social networks generated from acoustic tracking data, we document spatially structured sociality in CPF grey reef sharks at a Pacific Ocean atoll. We show that sharks form stable social groups over multiyear periods, with some dyadic associations consistent for up to 4 years. Groups primarily formed during the day, increasing in size throughout the morning before sharks dispersed from the reef at night. Our simulations suggest that multiple individuals sharing a central place and using social information while foraging (i.e. local enhancement) will outperform non-CPF social foragers. We show multiyear social stability in sharks and suggest that social foraging with information transfer could provide a generalizable mechanism for the emergence of sociality with group central place foraging.
897	32779267	Brain delivery of biologics using a cross-species reactive transferrin receptor 1 VNAR shuttle.	Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mediated transcytosis is an attractive strategy to enhance brain uptake of protein drugs, but translation remains a challenge. Here, a single domain shark antibody VNAR fragment (TXB2) with similar affinity to murine and human TfR1 was used to shuttle protein cargo into the brain. TXB2 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain (hFc) or to the amyloid-β (Aβ) antibody bapineuzumab (Bapi). TXB2-hFc displayed 20-fold higher brain concentrations compared with a control VNAR-hFc at 18 hours post-injection in wt mice. At the same time point, brain concentrations of Bapi-TXB2 was threefold higher than Bapi. In transgenic mice overexpressing human Aβ, the brain-to-blood concentration ratio increased with time due to interaction with intracerebral Aβ deposits. The relatively stable threefold difference between Bapi-TXB2 and Bapi was observed for up to 6 days after injection. PET imaging and ex vivo autoradiography revealed more parenchymal distribution of Bapi-TXB2 compared with Bapi. In conclusion, the TXB2 VNAR shuttle markedly increased brain uptake of protein cargo and increased brain concentrations of the Aβ binding antibody Bapi.
898	32776458	Hook-shaped enterolith and secondary cachexia in a free-living grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus, Rafinesque 1810).	The carcass of a critically endangered, juvenile female grey nurse shark (Carcharias taurus, Rafinesque 1810) was recovered from a south-eastern Australian beach and subjected to necropsy. The 1.98-m-long shark exhibited advanced cachexia with its total weight (19.0 kg) and liver weight (0.37 kg) reduced by 60% and 89%, respectively, compared with a healthy individual of the same length. Marked tissue decomposition was evident preventing histopathology and identification of a definitive cause of death. At necropsy, the abdominal organs were abnormally displaced and showed marked reductions in size compared with a healthy individual of the same size. Importantly, a hook-shaped enterolith (HSE), with a rough surface and cream in colour, was found within the spiral valve of the intestine and is to the authors' knowledge, the first description of such in any marine animal. X-ray diffractometry showed that the HSE comprised the minerals monohydrocalcite (Ca[CO₃].H₂O; ~70 wt%) and struvite (Mg [NH

The purpose of this study was to compare the flowability, dimension accuracy, and tear strength of four elastomeric die materials.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Materials were divided into four groups: Mach-2 (M2), Scan Die (SD), GrandioSO Inlay System (GIS), and Impregum-F (IM). Flowability analysis was carried out using the shark fin test (SFT). For dimension accuracy, impressions were taken from a premolar Class I preparation and an elastomeric model was cast. Composite resin restorations were built and positioned into the premolar for gap measurement. The mean gap length was divided into three levels: acceptable (A), not acceptable (NA), and misfit (M). For tear strength, strip specimens were made with a V-shaped notch (n = 6). The specimens were tested in a universal machine until tear. All data were analyzed statistically with a confidence interval of 95%.
RESULTS: GIS showed the lowest flowability values, with no differences between IM, M2, and SD. For dimension accuracy, IM showed 100% 'A' gap values, followed by M2 (80%), SD (60%), and GIS (60%). For tear strength, IM showed the highest values, followed by M2, GIS, and SD.
CONCLUSIONS: M2, SD, and IM had similar flowability, while GIS had the lowest. IM presented higher tear strength than M2, followed by GIS and SD. IM showed the highest degrees of acceptable gap filling, followed by M2."
902	32760084	From plentiful to critically endangered: Demographic evidence of the artisanal fisheries impact on the smalltail shark (Carcharhinus porosus) from Northern Brazil.	The smalltail shark, Carcharhinus porosus, was the most abundant elasmobranch species in fisheries off Brazil's northern coast (BNC) in the 1980s, but its population has been declining since the 1990s. For this reason, a demographic analysis is necessary to determine the extent of this decline and the fishing effect on the BNC's population. Therefore, we performed a stochastic demographic analysis of the population in the BNC, and considered its global center of abundance. Smalltail shark specimens (n = 937) were collected with gillnets in Maranhão state, eastern BNC, in the 1980s with sizes ranging between 29.6 and 120.0 cm total length. Most of the individuals (90.6%) caught were juveniles (< 6 years-old), and the mortality and exploitation rates showed that the species was overexploited (92.3% above the fishing mortality corresponding to the population equilibrium threshold). The smalltail shark's biological characteristics, such as slow growth and low fecundity, demonstrate that it is one of the least resilient species among similar sized coastal sharks in the region. All these factors yielded an annual decrease of 28% in the intrinsic population growth rate, resulting in a population decline of more than 90% in only 10 years, and much higher for the current period. This set of features comprising fishing recruitment occurring upon juveniles, overfishing, and intrinsically low resilience make the population unable to sustain fishing pressure and severely hamper biological recruitment, thus causing this drastic population decline. Furthermore, several local extinctions for this species in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil highlight its concerning conservation scenario. Therefore, since similar fisheries characteristics occur throughout its distribution range, C. porosus fits the criteria E of the IUCN Red List for a critically endangered species and urgent conservation measures are needed to prevent its extinction in the near future.
903	32757468	Natural environmental conditions and collaborative efforts provide the secret to success for sand tiger shark Carcharias taurus reproduction in aquaria.	Sand tiger sharks are an iconic large shark species held in aquaria worldwide. They rarely reproduce under managed care, with only seven aquaria reporting limited and sporadic success. For the first time in the Americas, a full-term young was born in an aquarium. The young was the result of breeding among a group of sharks purposefully brought together in 2016 for reproduction. Sharks were maintained in natural seawater and exposed to natural light and seasonal temperature fluctuations similar to their in situ counterparts. Decreased food consumption associated with breeding season and gestation was observed. Gestation time estimated from breeding observations and parturition was 321 days. Although the neonate was stillborn, this was a significant achievement. The husbandry details described within will be useful for other aquaria striving to support the reproduction of sand tiger sharks.
904	32756429	Does Subunit Composition Influence the Intermolecular Crosslinking of Fish Collagen? A Study with Hake and Blue Shark Skin Collagens.	Acid-soluble collagens from European hake and Blue shark skin were isolated, characterized, and compared. As the structure of collagen determines its function, the final objective of this study was to investigate biochemical differences between both collagens to identify future potential applications. Chromatographic behavior revealed differences in collagen from both species. Increases of temperature and stirring time produced no effect on European hake collagen solubility in the mobile phase, resulting in the same chromatographic profiles. Conversely, the application of temperature and stirring-time increments showed a positive effect on Blue shark collagen solubility, resulting in different chromatographic profiles and observing higher molecular weight components when sample is incubated at 50 °C (15 min) after 48 h stirring. To test if the different chromatographic behavior exhibited by both collagens could be influenced by differences in subunit composition (alpha-chains), cation exchange chromatography was employed to separate collagen subunits. The electrophoretic patterns and gel permeation chromatography with light-scattering detection (GPC-LS) results of the obtained cation exchange peak fractions revealed differences regarding subunit composition between both species, influencing the crosslinking pattern. This is the first comparative study using GPC-LS to provide information of European hake and Blue shark collagen subunit composition.

906	32743805	Integrative taxonomy identifies a new stingray species of the genus Hypanus Rafinesque, 1818 (Dasyatidae, Myliobatiformes), from the Tropical Southwestern Atlantic.	"An integrative approach by the congruence of genetics, morphology and ecological niche modelling (ENM) was used to delimit a new species of Hypanus (Rafinesque, 1818), a recently resurrected genus of marine stingrays comprising eight species, five of which occur in the western Atlantic. The species with the widest distribution, Hypanus americanus (Hildebrand and Schroeder, 1928), from the northeastern coast of the United States to southeastern Brazil, was demonstrated to be paraphyletic based on protein-coding mitochondrial genome analyses. This data set also indicates that the genetic distance between the new species Hypanus berthalutzae sp. nov. and its three closely related species (H. americanus, H. longus and H. rudis) varies from 0.82% to 3.14%. In addition, Bayesian Analysis of Population Similarity using the mitochondrial gene mt-nd2 supports the separation of H. berthalutzae sp. nov. (southwestern Atlantic) from its sister species H. rudis (eastern Atlantic). Similarly, morphological and morphometric analyses corroborated four morphotypes within the H. americanus species group and indicated the ventral caudal fold height and length and interspiracular and interorbital lengths as useful measurements to distinguish among them. Claspers of adult males also exhibit morphological differences among species. The ENM agreed with molecular and morphological analyses and delimits the distribution of H. berthalutzae sp. nov. to shallow areas close to shore along the Brazilian coast, from the mouth of the Amazon River to São Paulo State, including the northeastern oceanic islands, suggesting that the great outflow of fresh water and sediments and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge might act as barriers. The integration of these data to describe a new species provides information relevant to their conservation status, because all species of the H. americanus species group are under the ""data-deficient"" status."
907	32743800	Fish biodiversity of Saint Peter and Saint Paul's Archipelago, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Brazil: new records and a species database.	Saint Peter and Saint Paul's Archipelago (SPSPA), one of the smallest and most isolated island groups in the world, is situated on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, between Brazil and the African continent. SPSPA has low species richness and high endemism; nonetheless, the diversity of fishes from deep habitats (>30 m depth) had not been previously studied in detail. Several expeditions conducted between 2009 and 2018 explored the shallow and deep reefs of SPSPA using scuba, closed-circuit rebreathers, manned submersibles, baited remote underwater stereo-videos (stereo-BRUV) and fishing between 0 and 1050 m depth. These expeditions yielded 41 new records of fishes for SPSPA: 9 in open waters, 9 in shallow waters (0-30 m), 8 in mesophotic ecosystems (30-150 m) and 15 in deeper reefs (>150 m). Combined with literature records of adult pelagic, shallow and deep-reef species, as well as larvae, the database of the fish biodiversity for SPSPA currently comprises 225 species (169 recorded as adult fishes and 79 as larvae, with 23 species found in both stages). Most of them (112) are pelagic, 86 are reef-associated species and 27 are deep-water specialists. Species accumulation curves show that the number of fish species has not yet reached an asymptote. Whereas the number of species recorded in SPSPA is similar to that in other oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the proportion of shorefishes is relatively lower, and the endemism level is the third highest in the Atlantic. Twenty-nine species are listed as threatened with extinction. Observations confirm the paucity of top predators on shallow rocky reefs of the island, despite the presence of several pelagic shark species around SPSPA. Because all of the endemic species are reef associated, it is argued that the new marine-protected areas created by the Brazilian government do not ensure the protection and recovery of SPSPA's biodiversity because they allow exploitation of the most vulnerable species around the archipelago itself. This study suggests a ban on reef fish exploitation inside an area delimited by the 1000 m isobath around the islands (where all known endemics are concentrated) as the main conservation strategy to be included in the SPSPA management plan being prepared by the Brazilian government.
908	32737392	Species composition of the largest shark fin retail-market in mainland China.	Species-specific monitoring through large shark fin market surveys has been a valuable data source to estimate global catches and international shark fin trade dynamics. Hong Kong and Guangzhou, mainland China, are the largest shark fin markets and consumption centers in the world. We used molecular identification protocols on randomly collected processed fin trimmings (n = 2000) and non-parametric species estimators to investigate the species composition of the Guangzhou retail market and compare the species diversity between the Guangzhou and Hong Kong shark fin retail markets. Species diversity was similar between both trade hubs with a small subset of species dominating the composition. The blue shark (Prionace glauca) was the most common species overall followed by the CITES-listed silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), smooth hammerhead shark (S. zygaena) and shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus). Our results support previous indications of high connectivity between the shark fin markets of Hong Kong and mainland China and suggest that systematic studies of other fin trade hubs within Mainland China and stronger law-enforcement protocols and capacity building are needed.
909	32725818	The first reproductive parameters and evidence of multiple paternity in one new spiny dogfish species, Squalus albicaudus (Squaliformes, Squalidae).	Understanding elasmobranch reproductive biology is necessary for species conservation. Multiple paternity (MP) has been reported for elasmobranchs, and this study investigates the reproductive aspects and mating system (paternity genetic analyses) for Squalus albicaudus. Thirteen pregnant females were analysed concerning reproductive parameters, and the mating system was assessed for nine females and their litters. The study found a mean fecundity of 2.84 pups per litter without correlation between total female length and the number of embryos per litter. One litter showed evidence of MP, indicating the presence of polyandrous behaviour of the species.
910	32724124	Evolutionary trends of the conserved neurocranium shape in angel sharks (Squatiniformes, Elasmobranchii).	Elasmobranchii (i.e., sharks, skates, and rays) forms one of the most diverse groups of marine predators. With a fossil record extending back into the Devonian, several modifications in their body plan illustrate their body shape diversity through time. The angel sharks, whose fossil record dates back to the Late Jurassic, some 160 Ma, have a dorsoventrally flattened body, similar to skates and rays. Fossil skeletons of this group show that the overall morphology was well established earlier in its history. By examining the skull shape of well-preserved fossil material compared to extant angel sharks using geometric morphometric methods, within a phylogenetic framework, we were able to determine the conservative skull shape among angel sharks with a high degree of integration. The morphospace occupation of extant angel sharks is rather restricted, with extensive overlap. Most of the differences in skull shape are related to their geographic distribution patterns. We found higher levels of disparity in extinct forms, but lower ones in extant species. Since angel sharks display a highly specialized prey capture behaviour, we suggest that the morphological integration and biogeographic processes are the main drivers of their diversity, which might limit their capacity to display higher disparities since their origin.
911	32720305	Personality-driven life history trade-offs differ in two subpopulations of free-ranging predators.	Consistent individual differences in behaviour (i.e. personality) can be explained in an evolutionary context if they are favoured by life history trade-offs as conceptualized in the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis. Theory predicts that faster-growing individuals suffer higher mortality and that this trade-off is mediated through exploration/risk-taking personality, but empirical support for this remains limited and ambiguous. Equivocal support to the POLS hypothesis suggests that the link between life history and personality may only emerge under certain circumstances. Understanding personality-driven trade-offs would be facilitated by long-term studies in wild populations experiencing different ecological conditions. Here, we tested whether personality measured in semi-captivity was associated with a growth-mortality trade-off via risk-taking in the wild in two subpopulations of juvenile lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris known to differ in their predator abundance. We expected stronger personality-driven trade-offs in the predator-rich environment as compared to the predator-poor environment. Sharks were captured yearly from 1995 onwards allowing us to obtain long-term data on growth and apparent survival in each subpopulation. We then used a novel open-field assay to test sharks for exploration personality yearly from 2012 to 2017. A subset of the tested sharks was monitored in the field using telemetry to document risk-taking behaviours. We tested (a) if fast explorers in captivity took more risks and grew faster in the wild and (b) if natural selection acted against more explorative, faster-growing sharks. In the subpopulation with fewer predators, more explorative sharks in captivity took more risks in the wild and grew faster. In turn, larger, fast-growing sharks had lower apparent survival. In the predator-rich subpopulation, despite finding selection on fast growth, we found no link between exploration personality and the growth-mortality trade-off. Our study demonstrates that the association between personality and life history is favoured in some ecological contexts but not in others. We identify predator and resource abundance as two main potential drivers of the personality-mediated trade-off and emphasize that future work on the POLS hypothesis would benefit from an approach integrating behaviour and life history across ecological conditions.
912	32717287	The effects of digesting a urea-rich meal on North Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias suckleyi).	Marine elasmobranchs are nitrogen-limited owing to the requirement of nitrogen for both somatic growth and urea-based osmoregulation, and due to the loss of urea across the gills and kidney as nitrogenous waste. In this study we used in vitro stomach and intestinal gut sacs to investigate the effects of consuming a urea-rich meal (700 mM within a 2% body-mass ration of food-slurry) on nitrogen movement across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of North Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias suckleyi). Plasma urea concentrations did not differ between fasted (359 ± 19 mM), urea-poor fed (340 ± 16 mM), and urea-rich fed (332 ± 24 mM) dogfish. Interestingly, in vitro gut sacs of urea-rich fed dogfish showed no net urea absorption from the lumen over 3 h incubation, which contrasts previously published data on urea-poor fed dogfish that absorb urea from the lumen. In addition, ammonium (NH

The structure of chondroitin sulfate oligosaccharides (CSOs), especially their sulfation pattern, has been found to be closely related with many biological pathways and diseases. However, detailed functional analysis such as their interaction with glycan binding proteins (GBPs) has been lagging, presumably due to the unavailability of well-defined, diverse structures. Besides challenging chemical and enzymatic synthesis, this is also due to the challenges in their purification at the isomer level and structural analysis owing to their instability, structural complexity, and low mass spectrometry detection sensitivity. Herein, we first used recycling preparative HPLC to separate and purify shark CS tetrasaccharide component labeled by a bifunctional fluorescent linker 2-amino-

915	32708271	A Novel Visual Sensor Stabilization Platform for Robotic Sharks Based on Improved LADRC and Digital Image Algorithm.	Autonomous underwater missions require the construction of a stable visual sensing system. However, acquiring continuous steady image sequences is a very challenging task for bionic robotic fish due to their tight internal space and the inherent periodic disturbance caused by the tail beating. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a modified stabilization strategy that combines mechanical devices and digital image techniques to enhance the visual sensor stability and resist periodic disturbance. More specifically, an improved window function-based linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) was utilized for mechanical stabilization. Furthermore, a rapid algorithm with inertial measurement units (IMUs) was implemented for digital stabilization. The experiments regarding mechanical stabilization, digital stabilization, and target recognition on the experimental platform for simulating fishlike oscillations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The success of these experiments provides valuable insight into the construction of underwater visual sensing systems and also establishes a solid foundation for the visual applications for robotic fish in dynamic aquatic environments.
916	32703969	Discovery of a new mode of oviparous reproduction in sharks and its evolutionary implications.	"Two modes of oviparity are known in cartilaginous fishes, (1) single oviparity where one egg case is retained in an oviduct for a short period and then deposited, quickly followed by another egg case, and (2) multiple oviparity where multiple egg cases are retained in an oviduct for a substantial period and deposited later when the embryo has developed to a large size in each case. Sarawak swellshark Cephaloscyllium sarawakensis of the family Scyliorhinidae from the South China Sea performs a new mode of oviparity, which is named ""sustained single oviparity"", characterized by a lengthy retention of a single egg case in an oviduct until the embryo attains a sizable length. The resulting fecundity of the Sarawak swellshark within a season is quite low, but this disadvantage is balanced by smaller body, larger neonates and quicker maturation. The Sarawak swellshark is further uniquely characterized by having glassy transparent egg cases, and this is correlated with a vivid polka-dot pattern of the embryos. Five modes of lecithotrophic (yolk-dependent) reproduction, i.e. short single oviparity, sustained single oviparity, multiple oviparity, yolk-sac viviparity of single pregnancy and yolk-sac viviparity of multiple pregnancy were discussed from an evolutionary point of view."

919	32699221	Investigating the presence of microplastics in demersal sharks of the North-East Atlantic.	Microplastic pollution is ubiquitous in the marine environment and is ingested by numerous marine species. Sharks are an understudied group regarding their susceptibility to microplastic ingestion. Here, we provide evidence of ingestion of microplastic and other anthropogenic fibres in four demersal sharks species found in the waters of the United Kingdom and investigate whether body burdens of contamination vary according to species, sex or size. Sharks were collected from the North-East Atlantic. Stomachs and digestive tracts of 46 sharks of 4 species were examined and 67% of samples contained at least one contaminant particle. Although we acknowledge modest sample size, estimated particle burden increased with body size but did not vary systematically with sex or species. A total of 379 particles were identified, leading to median estimates ranging from 2 to 7.5 ingested contaminants per animal for the 4 species. The majority were fibrous in nature (95%) and blue (88%) or black (9%) in colour. A subsample of contaminants (N = 62) were subject to FT-IR spectroscopy and polymers identified as: synthetic cellulose (33.3%), polypropylene (25%), polyacrylamides (10%) and polyester (8.3%). The level of risk posed to shark species by this level of contamination is unknown. Nevertheless, this study presents the first empirical evidence and an important baseline for ingestion of microplastics and other anthropogenic fibres in native UK shark species and highlights the pervasive nature of these pollutants.

921	32691418	Identification of a nursery area for the critically endangered hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) amid intense fisheries in the southern Gulf of Mexico.	Since the 1980s, there has been growing concern in the Mexican Atlantic regarding high catches of neonate and juvenile sharks in small-scale fisheries. Fishery-dependent data from 1993 to 1994 and 2007 to 2017 and fishers' ecological knowledge from 2017 were used to identify nursery areas for scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Catch records and fishing areas of neonates, YOYs, juveniles and adults of S. lewini (N = 1885) were obtained from calcareous and terrigenous regions in the western Yucatan Peninsula. The results suggest that a nursery for scalloped hammerhead is found in the terrigenous region, characterized by relatively shallow and turbid waters due to rivers' discharges. Neonates and YOYs (96% and 86% of their total records, respectively) were commonly found there over the years in May-August in multiple fishing areas identified by fishers, although mainly between isobaths 10-30 m. The enforcement of management measures is necessary because the nursery is located in a region with intense fishing effort.

923	32678294	Environmental DNA detection tracks established seasonal occurrence of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) in a semi-enclosed subtropical bay.	The integration of eDNA analysis into the population assessment and monitoring of sharks could greatly improve temporal and spatial data used for management purposes. This study aimed to compare eDNA detection against well-established seasonal changes in blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) abundance in Terra Ceia Bay (FL, USA). We used a species-specific real-time PCR approach to detect C. limbatus eDNA in the bay on a near monthly basis from spring through mid-fall in 2018 and 2019. Previous studies have shown that C. limbatus give birth in the bay in early summer and immature sharks occur there until late fall, when decreasing water temperatures cause them to move offshore and southwards. Water samples (2 L) were collected (4-6 per month) and filtered in the field, with each then being subjected to real-time PCR. Carcharhinus limbatus 'positive' filters were significantly more commonly collected during the April-July sampling period than during the August-October sampling period. While following the predicted pattern, eDNA concentration was generally too low for accurate quantification. Our results show that C. limbatus eDNA detection follows known seasonal residency patterns consistently over 2 years of monitoring. Species-specific eDNA analysis using real-time PCR could therefore represent a cost-effective, scalable sampling tool to facilitate improved shark population monitoring in semi-enclosed marine habitats.
924	32672393	Behavioural sleep in two species of buccal pumping sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Cephaloscyllium isabellum).	Sleep is known to occur in most, if not all, animals studied thus far. Recent studies demonstrate the presence of sleep in flatworms and jellyfish, suggesting that this behaviour evolved early in the evolution of animals. Sharks are the earliest known extant, jawed vertebrates and may play an important role in understanding the evolutionary history of sleep in vertebrates, and yet, it is unknown whether they sleep. The Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and draughtsboard (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) sharks are both benthic, buccal pumping species and remain motionless for extended periods of time. Whether these periods of prolonged inactivity represent sleep or quiet wakefulness is unknown. A key criterion for separating sleep from other quiescent states is an increased arousal threshold. We show here that inactive sharks of both species require significantly higher levels of electric stimulation before they show a visible response. Sharks deprived of rest, however, show no significant compensatory increase in restfulness during their normal active period following enforced swimming. Nonetheless, increased arousal thresholds in inactive animals suggest that these two species of shark sleep - the first such demonstration for members of this group of vertebrates. Further research, including electrophysiological studies, on these and other sharks, is required for a comprehensive understanding of sleep in cartilaginous fishes.

As far as is known, in this paper the first case of lacking of skin-related structures (epidermis, stratum laxum, dermal denticles and teeth) in a free-swimming elasmobranch, the blackmouth catshark, Galeus melastomus, is reported. The individual was caught by trawl in Sardinian waters (central-western Mediterranean) in July 2019 at a depth of 500 m. Although this kind of morphological abnormality is potentially fatal, the observations suggested that the specimen was in good health and well developed.
926	32671837	Whale sharks Rhincodon typus get cleaned by the blue-streak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and the moon wrasse Thalassoma lunare in the Philippines.	Cleaning interactions are essential for healthy marine ecosystem communities. This study reports the first documentation of the whale shark Rhincodon typus cleaning behaviour in the Indo-West Pacific by two wrasse species, the blue-streak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and the moon wrasse Thalassoma lunare in Cebu, Philippines. This study documented 36 cleaning interactions with 14 individual whale sharks. The cleaning interactions appear opportunistic rather than targeted by the sharks, unlike that observed in other species of elasmobranchs. Further work should focus on understanding the drivers of these unique cleaning interactions.
927	32667920	Movement patterns and habitat use of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) across ontogeny in the Gulf of Mexico.	The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is globally distributed with established coastal and open-ocean movement patterns in many portions of its range. While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here.
928	32667054	The intraspecific diversity of tooth morphology in the large-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus stellaris: insights into the ontogenetic cues driving sexual dimorphism.	Teeth in sharks are shed and replaced throughout their lifetime. Morphological dental changes through ontogeny have been identified in several species and have been correlated with shifts in diet and the acquisition of sexual maturity. However, these changes were rarely quantified in detail along multiple ontogenetic stages, which makes it difficult to infer the developmental processes responsible for the observed plasticity. In this work, we use micro-computed tomography and 3D geometric morphometrics to describe and analyze the tooth size and shape diversity across three ontogenetic stages (hatchling, juvenile, and sexually mature) in the large-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus stellaris (Linnaeus, 1758). We first describe the intra-individual variation of tooth form for each sex at each ontogenetic stage. We provide a tooth morphospace for palatoquadrate and Meckelian teeth and identify dental features, such as relative size and number of cusps, involved in the range of variation of the observed morphologies. We then use these shape data to draw developmental trajectories between ontogenetic stages and for each tooth position within the jaw to characterize ontogenetic patterns of sexual dimorphism. We highlight the emergence of gynandric heterodonty between the juvenile and mature ontogenetic stages, with mature females having tooth morphologies more similar to juveniles' than mature males that display regression in the number of accessory cusps. From these data, we speculate on the developmental processes that could account for such developmental plasticity in S. stellaris.
929	32663287	The Dental Lamina: An Essential Structure for Perpetual Tooth Regeneration in Sharks.	In recent years, nonclassical models have emerged as mainstays for studies of evolutionary, developmental, and regenerative biology. Genomic advances have promoted the use of alternative taxa for the study of developmental biology, and the shark is one such emerging model vertebrate. Our research utilizes the embryonic shark (Scyliorhinus canicula) to characterize key developmental and regenerative processes that have been overlooked or not possible to study with more classic developmental models. Tooth development is a major event in the construction of the vertebrate body plan, linked in part with the emergence of jaws. Early development of the teeth and morphogenesis is well known from the murine model, but the process of tooth redevelopment and regeneration is less well known. Here we explore the role of the dental lamina in the development of a highly regenerative dentition in sharks. The shark represents a polyphyodont vertebrate with continuously repeated whole tooth regeneration. This is presented as a major developmental shift from the more derived renewal process that the murine model offers, where incisors exhibit continuous renewal and growth of the same tooth. Not only does the shark offer a study system for whole unit dental regeneration, it also represents an important model for understanding the evolutionary context of vertebrate tooth regeneration.
930	32655991	Multi-predator assemblages, dive type, bathymetry and sex influence foraging success and efficiency in African penguins.	Marine predators adapt their hunting techniques to locate and capture prey in response to their surrounding environment. However, little is known about how certain strategies influence foraging success and efficiency. Due to the miniaturisation of animal tracking technologies, a single individual can be equipped with multiple data loggers to obtain multi-scale tracking information. With the addition of animal-borne video data loggers, it is possible to provide context-specific information for movement data obtained over the video recording periods. Through a combination of video data loggers, accelerometers, GPS and depth recorders, this study investigated the influence of habitat, sex and the presence of other predators on the foraging success and efficiency of the endangered African penguin,

The Revillagigedo Archipelago National Park is the largest no-take Marine Protected Area in North America and it is essential for the conservation of globally endangered marine megafauna, including cetaceans, sea birds and cartilaginous fishes. The present paper reports the occurrence of 28 chondrichthyan species, including 19 sharks, seven batoids and two chimaeras in the Revillagigedo Archipelago, comprising eight new records and a brief revision of confirmed species to date.
932	32652526	Spontaneously occurring melanoma in animals and their relevance to human melanoma.	In contrast to other cancer types, melanoma incidence has been increasing over the last 50 years, and while it still represents less than 5% of all cutaneous malignancies, melanoma accounts for the majority of skin cancer deaths, due to its propensity to metastasise. Whilst melanoma most commonly affects the skin, it can also arise in mucosal surfaces, the eye, and the brain. For new therapies to be developed, a better understanding of the genetic landscape, signalling pathways, and tumour-microenvironmental interactions is needed. This is where animal models are of critical importance. The mouse is the foremost used model of human melanoma. Arguably this is due to its plethora of benefits as a laboratory animal; however, it is important to note that unlike humans, melanocytes are not present at the dermal-epidermal junction in mice and mice do not develop melanoma without genetic manipulation. In contrast, there are numerous reports of animals that spontaneously develop melanoma, ranging from sharks and parrots to hippos and monkeys. In addition, several domesticated and laboratory-bred animals spontaneously develop melanoma or UV-induced melanoma, specifically, fish, opossums, pigs, horses, cats, and dogs. In this review, we look at spontaneously occurring animal 'models' of melanoma and discuss their relevance to the different types of melanoma found in humans. © 2020 The Authors.

933	32639960	Ecological responses to blue water MPAs.	Marine protected areas (MPAs) can contribute to protecting biodiversity and managing ocean activities, including fishing. There is, however, limited evidence of ecological responses to blue water MPAs. We conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of impacts on fisheries production and ecological responses to pelagic MPAs of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. A Bayesian time series-based counterfactual modelling approach using fishery-dependent data was used to compare the temporal response in the MPAs to three reference regions for standardized catch rates, lengths, trophic level of the catch and species diversity. Catch rates of bigeye tuna, the main target species (Kingman/Palmyra MPA, causal effect probability >99% of an 84% reduction; 95% credible interval: -143%, -25%), and blue shark (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) were significantly lower and longnose lancetfish significantly higher (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) than predicted had the MPAs not been established, possibly from closing areas near shallow features, which aggregate pelagic predators, and from 'fishing-the-line'. There were no apparent causal impacts of the MPAs on species diversity, lengths and trophic level of the catch, perhaps because the MPAs were young, were too small, did not contain critical habitat for specific life-history stages, had been lightly exploited or experienced fishing-the-line. We also assessed model-standardized catch rates for species of conservation concern and mean trophic level of the catch within and outside of MPAs. Displaced effort produced multi-species conflicts: MPAs protect bycatch hotspots and hotspots of bycatch-to-target catch ratios for some at-risk species, but coldspots for others. Mean trophic level of the catch was significantly higher around MPAs, likely due to the aggregating effect of the shallow features and there having been light fishing pressure within MPAs. These findings demonstrate how exploring a wide range of ecological responses supports evidence-based evaluations of blue water MPAs.
934	32637626	Soft electromagnetic actuators.	Rigid electromagnetic actuators serve our society in a myriad of ways for more than 200 years. However, their bulky nature restricts close collaboration with humans. Here, we introduce soft electromagnetic actuators (SEMAs) by replacing solid metal coils with liquid-metal channels embedded in elastomeric shells. We demonstrate human-friendly, simple, stretchable, fast, durable, and programmable centimeter-scale SEMAs that drive a soft shark, interact with everyday objects, or rapidly mix a dye with water. A multicoil flower SEMA with individually controlled petals blooms or closes within tens of milliseconds, and a cubic SEMA performs programmed, arbitrary motion sequences. We develop a numerical model supporting design and opening potential routes toward miniaturization, reduction of power consumption, and increase in mechanical efficiency. SEMAs are electrically controlled shape-morphing systems that are potentially empowering future applications from soft grippers to minimally invasive medicine.
935	32636493	Behavioural responses of white sharks to specific baits during cage diving ecotourism.	This study describes the effect of different baits on the attraction, surface behaviour and conditioning of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias during local ecotourism activities. The sightings, behaviours, and pictures used for photographic identification were obtained during August to November 2012-2014 onboard tourist boats in Guadalupe Island, Mexico. Four types of baits were used: (1) frozen bait; (2) frozen bait and natural chum; (3) fresh fish bait; and (4) mackerel bags. Data were analysed according to sex, maturity and the total of sharks using 6,145 sightings of 121 white sharks. The type of bait showed no significant difference on the effectiveness to attracting sharks. Ethological analysis showed that the type of bait had a significant effect on the shark's surface behaviour during its interactions with boats. Natural chum and fresh baits showed short term behavioural patterns constituted by increased number of violent interactions with the bait, while the frozen bait did not generate a defined behavioural pattern. Conditioning of white sharks was determined by the number of interactions and the consumption frequency of the bait. Fifty nine percent of sharks (n = 41) showed no conditioning, 36% (n = 25) showed a low risk and only 5% (n = 3) were found to have a high risk of conditioning. The results suggest that current ecotourism has no effect on the conditioning of the white sharks, and that all baits have a similar effectiveness for attracting the sharks. However, a different behavioural pattern was observed when fresh bait and chum were used, which could increase the potential of accidents during ecotourism.
936	32628691	Spatially congruent sites of importance for global shark and ray biodiversity.	Many important areas identified for conservation priorities focus on areas of high species richness, however, it is unclear whether these areas change depending on what aspect of richness is considered (e.g. evolutionary distinctiveness, endemicity, or threatened species). Furthermore, little is known of the extent of spatial congruency between biodiversity measures in the marine realm. Here, we used the distribution maps of all known marine sharks, rays, and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes) to examine the extent of spatial congruency across the hotspots of three measures of species richness: total number of species, evolutionarily distinct species, and endemic species. We assessed the spatial congruency between hotspots considering all species, as well as on the subset of the threatened species only. We consider three definitions of hotspot (2.5%, 5%, and 10% of cells with the highest numbers of species) and three levels of spatial resolution (1°, 4°, and 8° grid cells). Overall, we found low congruency among all three measures of species richness, with the threatened species comprising a smaller subset of the overall species patterns irrespective of hotspot definition. Areas of congruency at 1° and 5% richest cells contain over half (64%) of all sharks and rays and occurred off the coasts of: (1) Northern Mexico Gulf of California, (2) USA Gulf of Mexico, (3) Ecuador, (4) Uruguay and southern Brazil, (5) South Africa, southern Mozambique, and southern Namibia, (6) Japan, Taiwan, and parts of southern China, and (7) eastern and western Australia. Coarsening resolution increases congruency two-fold for all species but remains relatively low for threatened measures, and geographic locations of congruent areas also change. Finally, for pairwise comparisons of biodiversity measures, evolutionarily distinct species richness had the highest overlap with total species richness regardless of resolution or definition of hotspot. We suggest that focusing conservation attention solely on areas of high total species richness will not necessarily contribute efforts towards species that are most at risk, nor will it protect other important dimensions of species richness.
937	32626858	Anti-DLL4 VNAR targeted nanoparticles for targeting of both tumour and tumour associated vasculature.	Whilst there is an extensive body of preclinical nanomedicine research, translation to clinical settings has been slow. Here we present a novel approach to the targeted nanoparticle (NP) concept: utilizing both a novel targeting ligand, VNAR (Variable New Antigen Receptor), a shark-derived single chain binding domain, and an under-investigated target in delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4). We describe the development of an anti-DLL4 VNAR and the site-specific conjugation of this to poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid PEGylated NPs using surface maleimide functional groups. These nanoconjugates were shown to specifically bind DLL4 with high affinity and were preferentially internalized by DLL4-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines and endothelial cells. Furthermore, a distinct anti-angiogenic effect endowed by the anti-DLL4 VNAR was evident in in vitro tubulogenic assays. Taken together these findings highlight the potential of anti-DLL4 targeted polymeric NPs as a novel therapeutic approach in pancreatic cancer.
938	32621516	Estimating population parameters of broadnose sevengill sharks (Notorynchus cepedianus) using photo identification capture-recapture.	The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is a common high trophic-level predator around coastal New Zealand. Data on the ecology of the species in New Zealand are severely lacking, and anthropogenic impacts are unquantified. To partially address this, the authors undertook a study of the demographics of a population at Stewart Island. Sampling trips were carried out seasonally from winter 2016 to spring 2017. A baited underwater video system (BUV) was deployed on 133 occasions (mean = 22.2 deployments per season) in a shallow coastal embayment to capture underwater video of N. cepedianus for photo identification of individuals. N. cepedianus was detected on all but one deployment. Images extracted from video recorded the presence of 149 different individuals. Capture-recapture analysis of these data using robust design methods indicated a seasonal trend in abundance of the population using the study area, ranging from 34 (95% C.I. = 21-55) during winter 2016, to 94 (95% C.I. = 44-199) during spring 2017. This study presents the first data on demographic parameters of N. cepedianus in New Zealand.
939	32620846	Ontogenetic trophic segregation between two threatened smooth-hound sharks in the Central Mediterranean Sea.	"Elasmobranchs are among the species most threatened by overfishing and a large body of evidence reports their decline around the world. As they are large predators occupying the highest levels of marine food webs, their removal can alter the trophic web dynamic through predatory release effects and trophic cascade. Suitable management of threatened shark species requires a good understanding of their behaviour and feeding ecology. In this study we provide one of the first assessments of the trophic ecology of the ""vulnerable"" smooth-hounds Mustelus mustelus and M. punctulatus in the Central Mediterranean Sea, based on stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. Ontogenetic diet changes were addressed by comparing the feeding habits of three groups of individuals: juveniles, maturing and adults. Our results highlighted that the two species share a similar diet based mostly on the consumption of benthic crustaceans (e.g. hermit crabs). Their trophic level increases during ontogeny, with adults increasing their consumption of large-sized crustaceans (e.g. Calappa granulata, Palinurus elephas), cephalopods (e.g. Octopus vulgaris) and fish (e.g. Trachurus trachurus). Our results provide also evidence of ontogenetic shifts in diet for both species showing a progressive reduction of interspecific trophic overlap during growth. The results of this study contribute to improve the current knowledge on the trophic ecology of these two threatened sharks in the Strait of Sicily, thus providing a better understanding of their role in the food web."
941	32617556	Evolution of the Dentition in Holocephalans (Chondrichthyes) Through Tissue Disparity.	The Holocephali is a major group of chondrichthyan fishes, the sister taxon to the sharks and rays (Elasmobranchii). However, the dentition of extant holocephalans is very different from that of the elasmobranchs, lacking individual tooth renewal, but comprising dental plates made entirely of self-renewing dentine. This renewal of all tissues occurs at the postero-lingual plate surface, as a function of their statodont condition. The fossil record of the holocephalans illuminates multiple different trends in the dentition, including shark-like teeth through to those with dentitions completely lacking individual teeth. Different taxa illustrate developmental retention of teeth but with fusion in their serial development. Dentine of different varieties comprises these teeth and composite dental plates, whose histology includes vascularized tubes within coronal dentine, merging with basal trabecular dentine. In this coronal vascularized dentine, extensive hypermineralization forms a wear resistant tissue transformed into a variety of morphologies. Through evolution, hypermineralized dentine becomes enclosed within the trabecular dentine, and specialized by reduction into specific zones within a composite dental plate, with these increasing in morphological disparity, all reflecting loss of defined teeth but retention of dentine production from the inherited developmental package.

944	32598385	Armored eyes of the whale shark.	This report elaborates on adaptations of the eyes of the whale shark Rhincodon typus (Elasmobranchii, Rhincodontidae), including the discovery that they are covered with dermal denticles, which is a novel mechanism of eye protection in vertebrates. The eye denticle differs in morphology from that of the dermal denticles distributed over the rest of the body, consistent with a different function (abrasion resistance). We also demonstrate that the whale shark has a strong ability to retract the eyeball into the eye socket. The retraction distance was calculated to be approximately half the diameter of the eye, which is comparable to those of other vertebrates that are known to have highly retractable eyes. These highly protective features of the whale shark eye seem to emphasize the importance of vision for environmental perception, which contradicts the general, though poorly established, notion of low reliance on vision in this species.
947	32595852	Swimming With Sharks: Teaching Residents Value-Based Medicine and Quality Improvement Through Resident-Pitched Projects.	"BACKGROUND: To create meaningful quality improvement (QI) curricula for graduate medical education (GME) trainees, institutions strive to improve coordination of QI curricula with hospital improvement infrastructure.
OBJECTIVE: We created a curriculum to teach residents about QI and value-based medicine (VBM) and assessed curricular effectiveness.
METHODS: We designed a 2-week required curriculum for internal medicine residents at a large academic program. After participating in basic skills workshops, trainees developed QI/VBM project ideas with faculty and nonclinical support and pitched them to hospital leaders at the end of the rotation. Pre-post and 1-year follow-up surveys were conducted for residents to self-assess knowledge, attitudes, and skills, participation in QI/VBM projects, and career intentions. We tracked QI/VBM project implementation.
RESULTS: In the first 2 years (2017-2018), 92 trainees participated, and 71 of 76 (93%) recommended the curriculum. Surveys (76 of 92, 83%) show improvement in our learning objectives (12%-60% pre to 62%-97% post; 
CONCLUSIONS: Our project-based curriculum culminating in a project pitch to hospital leadership was acceptable to GME trainees, improved self-assessed skills sustained at 1 year, and resulted in successfully implemented QI/VBM projects."
948	32592495	First records of the seven-gilled Notorynchus cepedianus and six-gilled Hexanchus griseus sharks (Chondrichthyes: Hexanchiformes: Hexanchidae) found in the Galápagos Marine Reserve.	This study reports the first records of cowsharks (Hexanchidae) in the Galápagos Islands, in particular Notorynchus cepedianus and Hexanchus griseus, observed between depths of 210 and 418 m on footage from free-falling autonomous deep-ocean cameras. These sightings provide new information on the habitat preferences and range distribution for N. cepedianus and the first records of H. griseus in Ecuadorian waters. The findings support the formulation of regional conservation strategies for these large apex predator species and highlight the limited biological knowledge of Galápagos' deep-water ecosystems.
949	32591403	Analysis of the Chinese Alligator TCRα/δ Loci Reveals the Evolutionary Pattern of Atypical TCRδ/TCRμ in Tetrapods.	Atypical TCRδ found in sharks, amphibians, birds, and monotremes and TCRμ found in monotremes and marsupials are TCR chains that use Ig or BCR-like variable domains (VHδ/Vμ) rather than conventional TCR V domains. These unconventional TCR are consistent with a scenario in which TCR and BCR, although having diverged from each other more than 400 million years ago, continue to exchange variable gene segments in generating diversity for Ag recognition. However, the process underlying this exchange and leading to the evolution of these atypical TCR receptor genes remains elusive. In this study, we identified two TCRα/δ gene loci in the Chinese alligator (
950	32590319	Mercury isotopes as tracers of ecology and metabolism in two sympatric shark species.	In coastal ecosystems, top predators are exposed to a wide variety of nutrient and contaminant sources due to the diversity of trophic webs within inshore marine habitats. Mercury contamination could represent an additional threat to shark populations that are declining worldwide. Here we measured total mercury, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, as well as mercury isotopes, in two co-occurring shark species (the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas and the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) and their potential prey from a coastal ecosystem of the western Indian Ocean (La Réunion Island). Our primary goals were to (i) determine the main trophic Hg sources for sharks and (ii) better characterize their diet composition and foraging habitat. Hg isotope signatures (Δ
951	32589911	Integrating Genetic, Environmental, and Social Networks to Reveal Transmission Pathways of a Dolphin Foraging Innovation.	"Cultural behavior, which is transmitted among conspecifics through social learning [1], is found across various taxa [2-6]. Vertical social transmission from parent to offspring [7] is thought to be adaptive because of the parental generation being more skilled than maturing individuals. It is found throughout the animal kingdom, particularly in species with prolonged parental care, e.g., [8, 9]. Social learning can also occur among members of the same generation [4, 10, 11] or between older, non-parental individuals and younger generations [7] via horizontal or oblique transmission, respectively. Extensive work on primate culture has shown that horizontal transmission of foraging behavior is biased toward species with broad cultural repertoires [12] and those with increased levels of social tolerance [13, 14], such as great apes. Vertical social transmission has been established as the primary transmission mechanism of foraging behaviors in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population of Shark Bay, Western Australia [6, 9, 15, 16]. Here, we investigated the spread of another foraging strategy, ""shelling"" [17], whereby some dolphins in this population feed on prey trapped inside large marine gastropod shells. Using a multi-network version of ""network-based diffusion analysis"" (NBDA), we show that shelling behavior spreads primarily through non-vertical social transmission. By statistically accounting for both environmental and genetic influences, our findings thus represent the first evidence of non-vertical transmission of a foraging tactic in toothed whales. This research suggests there are multiple transmission pathways of foraging behaviors in dolphins, highlighting the similarities between cetaceans and great apes in the nature of the transmission of cultural behaviors. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
952	32588156	Thermal effects on red muscle contractile performance in deep-diving, large-bodied fishes.	Bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are large, pelagic fishes, which make long-duration, diurnal foraging dives from warm, surface waters (18-24 °C) to cold waters beneath the thermocline (5-10 °C). In bigeye thresher sharks, the subcutaneous position of the red, aerobic swimming muscles (RM) suggests that RM temperature mirrors ambient during dives (i.e., ectothermy). In swordfish, the RM is closer to the vertebrae and its associated with vascular counter-current heat exchangers that maintain RM temperature above ambient (i.e., RM endothermy). Here, we sought to determine how exposure to a wide range of ambient temperatures (8, 16, 24 °C) impacted peak power output and optimum cycle (i.e., tailbeat) frequency (0.25, 0.5, 1 Hz) in RM isolated from both species. Bigeye thresher shark RM did not produce substantial power at high cycle frequencies, even at high temperatures; but it did produce relatively high power at slow cycle frequencies regardless of temperature. Swordfish RM produced more power when operating at a combination of fast cycle frequencies and higher temperatures. This suggests that swordfish RM benefits considerably more from warming than bigeye thresher shark RM, while the RM of both species was able to produce power at cold temperatures and slow cycle frequencies. Despite different thermal strategies (i.e., ectothermy vs. RM endothermy), the ability of the RM to power sustained swimming during foraging-related search behaviors may contribute to the unique ability of these fishes to successfully exploit food resources in deep, cold water.
953	32584448	The multiscale architecture of tessellated cartilage and its relation to function.	When describing the architecture and ultrastructure of animal skeletons, introductory biology, anatomy and histology textbooks typically focus on the few bone and cartilage types prevalent in humans. In reality, cartilage and bone are far more diverse in the animal kingdom, particularly within fishes (Chondrichthyes and Actinopterygii), where cartilage and bone types are characterized by features that are anomalous or even pathological in human skeletons. This review discusses the curious and complex architectures of shark and ray tessellated cartilage, highlighting similarities and differences with their mammalian skeletal tissue counterparts. By synthesizing older anatomical literature with recent high-resolution structural and materials characterization work, this review frames emerging pictures of form-function relationships in this tissue and of the evolution and true diversity of cartilage and bone.

The velvet belly lanternshark, Etmopterus spinax, uses counterillumination to disappear in the surrounding blue light of its marine environment. This shark displays hormonally controlled bioluminescence in which melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) trigger light emission, while α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) play an inhibitory role. The extraocular encephalopsin (Es-Opn3) was also hypothesized to act as a luminescence regulator. The majority of these compounds (MT, α-MSH, ACTH, opsin) are members of the rapid physiological colour change that regulates the pigment motion within chromatophores in metazoans. Interestingly, the lanternshark photophore comprises a specific iris-like structure (ILS), partially composed of melanophore-like cells, serving as a photophore shutter. Here, we investigated the role of (i) Es-Opn3 and (ii) actors involved in both MT and α-MSH/ACTH pathways on the shark bioluminescence and ILS cell pigment motions. Our results reveal the implication of Es-Opn3, MT, inositol triphosphate (IP
956	32576876	Spatiotemporal distribution patterns of immature Australasian white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias).	In Australian and New Zealand waters, current knowledge on white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) movement ecology is based on individual tracking studies using relatively small numbers of tags. These studies describe a species that occupies highly variable and complex habitats. However, uncertainty remains as to whether the proposed movement patterns are representative of the wider population. Here, we tagged 103 immature Australasian white sharks (147-350 cm fork length) with both acoustic and satellite transmitters to expand our current knowledge of population linkages, spatiotemporal dynamics and coastal habitats. Eighty-three sharks provided useable data. Based on individual tracking periods of up to 5 years and a total of 2,865 days of tracking data, we were able to characterise complex movement patterns over ~45° of latitude and ~72° of longitude and distinguish regular/recurrent patterns from occasional/exceptional migration events. Shark movements ranged from Papua New Guinea to sub-Antarctic waters and to Western Australia, highlighting connectivity across their entire Australasian range. Results over the 12-year study period yielded a comprehensive characterisation of the movement ecology of immature Australasian white sharks across multiple spatial scales and substantially expanded the body of knowledge available for population assessment and management.
957	32573715	Beware, commercial chondroitinases vary in activity and substrate specificity.	Chondroitin sulfate (CS)and dermatan sulfate (DS) are negatively charged polysaccharides found abundantly in animal tissue and have been extensively described to play key roles in health and disease. The most common method to analyze their structure is by digestion into disaccharides with bacterial chondroitinases, followed by chromatography and/or mass spectrometry. While studying the structure of oncofetal CS, we noted a large variation in the activity and specificity of commercially available chondroitinases. Here studied the kinetics of the enzymes and used high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine the di- and oligosaccharide products resulting from the digestion of commercially available bovine CS A, shark CS C and porcine DS, focusing on chondroitinases ABC, AC and B from different vendors. Application of a standardized assay setup demonstrated large variations in the enzyme-specific activity compared to the values provided by vendors, large variation in enzyme specific activity of similar enzymes from different vendors and differences in the extent of cleavage of the substrates and the generated products. The high variability of different chondroitinases highlights the importance of testing enzyme activity and monitoring product formation in assessing the content and composition of chondroitin and DSs in cells and tissues.
958	32567143	Characterization of fish collagen from blue shark skin and its application for chitosan- collagen composite coating to preserve red porgy (Pagrus major) meat.	Pepsin soluble collagen (PSC) was extracted from blue shark (Prionace glauca) skin and was used for chitosan-collagen composite coating to investigate coating effects on fresh red porgy (Pagrus major) fillet quality during storage at 4°C. Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), pH, K value, drip loss, and sensory evaluation scores were measured as deterioration indexes. Results show that coating by 1% of chitosan solutions containing 0.0%-0.8% of PSC significantly improved most deterioration indexes. Coating by 1% of chitosan solution containing 0.8% of PSC yielded the best results for K value, drip loss, and sensory evaluation, although the other indexes show no clear PSC concentration dependence. These results indicate 1% of chitosan solution containing 0.8% of PSC as the best coating formulation examined in this study. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Aquatic products have high contents of water and protein. Their qualities are likely to decline because of endogenous chemical and enzyme reactions, and also because of the role of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms during storage. The edible collagen and chitosan coating suggested by this research is biodegradable, biocompatible, cost effective, and is able to meet the requirements for food quality and storage duration. Pepsin soluble collagen (PSC) is an aquatic product processing by-product that makes the maximum use of resources. As described herein, a composite formulation comprising collagen and chitosan improves preservation effects of different types of coatings. A more high-quality and effective edible coating formulation was obtained, thereby extending the red porgy fillet shelf life.
959	32557707	Suboccipital muscle of sharpnose sevengill shark Heptranchias perlo and its possible role in prey dissection.	Skull and head muscles of Heptranchias perlo were studied. Its distinctive features include the suboccipital muscles, described for the first time, the absence of the palatoquadrate symphysis, a longitudinally extended mouth, and teeth unsuited for dissecting prey in typical method of modern sharks, which is cutting motions powered by head shaking from side to side. The palatoquadrate cartilages of H. perlo and closely related Hexanchidae articulate with the neurocranium via orbital and postorbital articulations, which together allow for lateral expansion of the jaws, but restrict retraction and protraction. We interpret these features as an adaptation to a different method of prey dissection, that is, ripping in a backward pull. It employs the specific postorbital articulation together with the suboccipital muscles as force-transmitting devices, and is powered by swimming muscles which produce a rearward thrust of the tail. During this type of dissection, the anterior part of the vertebral column should experience a tensile stress which explains the replacement of rigid vertebral bodies by a collagenous sheath around the notochord in H. perlo. The backward-ripping dissection could have been common among ancient Elasmobranchii based on the similarly developed postorbital articulation, a longitudinally extended mouth, and the absence of the palatoquadrate symphysis. A biomechanical comparison with the extinct Pucapampella indicates that ancient elasmobranchs could be also specialized in the backward-ripping prey dissection, but their mechanism was different from that inferred for H. perlo. We suggest that in the early evolution of sharks this mechanism was replaced by head-shaking dissection and then later was restored in H. perlo on a new morphological basis. A new position of the postorbital articulation below the vertebral axis is fraught with the braincase elevation when backward ripping the prey, and as a counter-mean, requires formation of suboccipital portions of the axial musculature unknown in other sharks. Homology and origin of these portions is considered.
960	32554099	Whale burial and organic matter impacts on biogeochemical cycling in beach aquifers and leachate fluxes to the nearshore zone.	Coastal managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of disposing of stranded whale carcasses on beaches. Direct burial in the beach is often used as a cost effective method of disposal. However, whale burial management plans are often met with public resistance owing to the perceived risk of shark attraction to burial leachate that may discharge from the seabed. A reactive transport model was combined with a numerical variable-density groundwater flow model to assess buried whale leachate plume formation, transport, influence on beach aquifer reactivity, and discharge to coastal surface water for a range of burial setback distances, depths, and whale sizes. A second set of simulations was performed to evaluate aquifer nitrate removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios and to evaluate the role of organic carbon source on beach reactivity. A sensitivity analysis was performed for both sets of models across ten physical and reaction parameters. Simulations using the best estimate parameter set showed that whale burials can produce DOC and ammonium leachate plumes in the beach aquifer that are transported to and discharge near the low tide line in water depths of 0.4-2.4 m. DOC and ammonium concentrations in discharging whale leachate were1.6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations, respectively. Of the factors tested, the burial distance inland from the high tide line was the most important factor affecting leachate fluxes to surface water. Burials placed farther inland led to smaller DOC fluxes to surface water, but increased ammonium fluxes. Burial depth also affected whale leachate to the subtidal zone, with deeper burials resulting in smaller fluxes of DOC. Leached DOC from whale decomposition and from buried wrack can fuel denitrification hotspots within beach sediments. The sensitivity analysis showed that nitrate removal supported by buried wrack and whale leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties, hydrologic forcing, and reaction parameters. The wrack model results have implications for beach scraping and the whale burial models show that whale leachate can be delivered to the shallow subtidal zone via groundwater discharge pathways, with potential implications for shark attraction and whale burial management practices.
961	32553953	Microstructure and characteristic properties of dogfish skin gelatin gels prepared by freeze/spray-drying methods.	The effects of two pretreatments (microwaves or oven-drying) on the dogfish (Squalus acanthias) skin as well as two drying processes (freeze-drying or spray-drying) on the extracted gelatins were studied. Thus six types of gelatins were obtained, three of which were freeze-dried (FG) and the others were spray-dried (SG), from the untreated skin (US), microwaves-pretreated skin (MS) and oven-pretreated skin (OS). The highest yield (8.67%) was obtained for the OSFG, while the lowest one (3.06%) was measured for the OSSG. Interestingly, all gelatins exhibited relatively high protein (84.02-89.53%), and low lipid (0.50-1.71%) and ash (3.05-7.17%) contents. In addition, gelatins were analyzed by the Fourier transform infrared and the spectra displayed important differences in some specific peaks, particularly in the amide I, amide II and amide III. The gelatins extracted from the untreated skin, regardless the drying method, presented the highest foaming capacity. The textural profile analysis showed that USSG was the hardest (213.6 g) and the chewier (23.8 N × mm) gelatin. Moreover, analysis of thermal properties showed that USSG also has the highest glass-transition temperature. The interesting properties of gelatin extracted from dogfish skin encourage their future use as a functional ingredient in industrial food formulations.
962	32553133	Inaccurate and Biased Global Media Coverage Underlies Public Misunderstanding of Shark Conservation Threats and Solutions.	Sharks are a taxon of significant conservation concern and associated public interest. The scientific community largely supports management policies focusing on sustainable fisheries exploitation of sharks, but many concerned members of the public and some environmental advocates believe that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist and therefore support total bans on all shark fisheries and/or trade in shark products. The belief that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist persists despite scientific evidence showing that they can and do, and are important to livelihoods. Additionally, many concerned members of the public are only aware of one threat to sharks and are unaware of other threats-or of most available policy solutions. Here we assess whether the popular press plays a role in spreading misinformation and misunderstanding about these issues via the agenda-setting, priming, and cultivation roles of the media, with the goal of better understanding the causes and consequences of public confusion.
963	32551076	Implications of life history uncertainty when evaluating status in the Northwest Atlantic population of white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).	To effectively protect at-risk sharks, resource managers and conservation practitioners must have a good understanding of how fisheries removals contribute to changes in abundance and how regulatory restrictions may impact a population trajectory. This means they need to know the number of animals being removed from a population and whether a given number of removals will lead to population increases or declines. For white shark (

Gastrointestinal (GI) pathology is common in elasmobranchs; however, information regarding normal GI transit time and the effect of therapeutics on GI motility is lacking. The objective of this study was to determine baseline gastric emptying and GI transit times in cownose rays (
965	32539172	Dental morphology and microstructure of the Prickly Dogfish Oxynotus bruniensis (Squaliformes: Oxynotidae).	This study describes and illustrates the jaws, teeth, and tooth microstructure of the Prickly Dogfish Oxynotus bruniensis. Detailed accounts of the dental morphology of O. bruniensis are rare and have not addressed the tissue arrangement or microstructure of the teeth. These features are documented and discussed in the contexts of interspecific comparisons with other elasmobranchs and the dietary specialization of O. bruniensis. The overall tooth morphology of O. bruniensis is similar to those of other closely related members in the order Squaliformes, as is the tissue arrangement, or histotype. Oxynotus bruniensis exhibits a simplified enameloid microstructure, which we compare with previously documented enameloid microstructures of other elasmobranchs. Though subtle interspecific differences in dental characters are documented, neither overall tooth morphology nor histotype and microstructure are unique to O. bruniensis. We conclude that in the case of O. bruniensis, dietary specialization is facilitated by behavioral rather than morphological specialization.
967	32537223	Was the Devonian placoderm Titanichthys a suspension feeder?	Large nektonic suspension feeders have evolved multiple times. The apparent trend among apex predators for some evolving into feeding on small zooplankton is of interest for understanding the associated shifts in anatomy and behaviour, while the spatial and temporal distribution gives clues to an inherent relationship with ocean primary productivity and how past and future perturbations to these may impact on the different tiers of the food web. The evolution of large nektonic suspension feeders-'gentle giants'-occurred four times among chondrichthyan fishes (e.g. whale sharks, basking sharks and manta rays), as well as in baleen whales (mysticetes), the Mesozoic pachycormid fishes and at least twice in radiodontan stem group arthropods (Anomalocaridids) during the Cambrian explosion. The Late Devonian placoderm

"BACKGROUND: The vertebrate clade diverged into Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays, and chimeras) and Osteichthyes fishes (bony fishes) approximately 420 mya, with each group accumulating vast anatomical and physiological differences, including skin properties. The skin of Chondrichthyes fishes is covered in dermal denticles, whereas Osteichthyes fishes are covered in scales and are mucous rich. The divergence time among these two fish groups is hypothesized to result in predictable variation among symbionts. Here, using shotgun metagenomics, we test if patterns of diversity in the skin surface microbiome across the two fish clades match predictions made by phylosymbiosis theory. We hypothesize (1) the skin microbiome will be host and clade-specific, (2) evolutionary difference in elasmobranch and teleost will correspond with a concomitant increase in host-microbiome dissimilarity, and (3) the skin structure of the two groups will affect the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes.
RESULTS: We show that the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes is host-specific. Teleost fish had lower average microbiome within clade similarity compared to among clade comparison, but their composition is not different among clade in a null based model. Elasmobranch's average similarity within clade was not different than across clade and not different in a null based model of comparison. In the comparison of host distance with microbiome distance, we found that the taxonomic composition of the microbiome was related to host distance for the elasmobranchs, but not the teleost fishes. In comparison, the gene function composition was not related to the host-organism distance for elasmobranchs but was negatively correlated with host distance for teleost fishes.
CONCLUSION: Our results show the patterns of phylosymbiosis are not consistent across both fish clades, with the elasmobranchs showing phylosymbiosis, while the teleost fish are not. The discrepancy may be linked to alternative processes underpinning microbiome assemblage, including possible historical host-microbiome evolution of the elasmobranchs and convergent evolution in the teleost which filter specific microbial groups. Our comparison of the microbiomes among fishes represents an investigation into the microbial relationships of the oldest divergence of extant vertebrate hosts and reveals that microbial relationships are not consistent across evolutionary timescales.

969	32532545	Viral vectored hepatitis C virus vaccines generate pan-genotypic T cell responses to conserved subdominant epitopes.	"BACKGROUND: Viral genetic variability presents a major challenge to the development of a prophylactic hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine. A promising HCV vaccine using chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAd) encoding a genotype (gt) 1b non-structural protein (ChAd-Gt1b-NS) generated high magnitude T cell responses. However, these T cells showed reduced cross-recognition of dominant epitope variants and the vaccine has recently been shown to be ineffective at preventing chronic HCV. To address the challenge of viral diversity, we developed ChAd vaccines encoding HCV genomic sequences that are conserved between all major HCV genotypes and adjuvanted by truncated shark invariant chain (sIi
METHODS: Age-matched female mice were immunised intramuscularly with ChAd (10
RESULTS: Conserved segment vaccines, ChAd-Gt1/3 and ChAd-Gt1-6, generated high-magnitude, broad, and functional CD4
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that genetically adjuvanted ChAd vectored HCV T cell vaccines encoding genetic sequences conserved between genotypes are immunogenic, activating T cells that target subdominant conserved HCV epitopes. These pre-clinical studies support the use of conserved segment HCV T cell vaccines in human clinical trials."

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects of skate cartilage extracts containing chondroitin sulfate (SCS) on hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in high cholesterol diet (HCD)-fed mice in comparison with the effects of shark cartilage-derived chondroitin sulfate (CS).
MATERIALS/METHODS: Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-KO) mice were fed HCD with an oral administration of CS (50 and 100 mg/kg BW/day), SCS (100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day), or water, respectively, for ten weeks.
RESULTS: The administration of CS or SCS reduced the levels of serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and LDL cholesterol and elevated the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with those of the control group (
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the biological effects of SCS, similar to those of CS, are attributed to improved lipid profiles as well as suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress induced by the intake of HCD."
971	32526329	Cartilaginous fishes offer unique insights into the evolution of the nuclear receptor gene repertoire in gnathostomes.	Nuclear receptors (NRs) are key transcription factors that originated in the common ancestor of metazoans. The vast majority of NRs are triggered by binding to either endogenous (e.g. retinoic acid) or exogenous (e.g. xenobiotics) ligands, and their evolution and expansion is tightly linked to the function of endocrine systems. Importantly, they represent classic targets of physiological exploitation by endocrine disrupting chemicals. The NR gene repertoire in different lineages has been shaped by gene loss, duplication and mutation, denoting a dynamic evolutionary route. As the earliest diverging class of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), cartilaginous fishes offer an exceptional opportunity to address the early diversification of NR gene families and the evolution of the endocrine system in jawed vertebrates. Here we provide an exhaustive analysis into the NR gene composition in five elasmobranch (sharks and rays) and two holocephalan (chimaeras) species. For this purpose, we generated also a low coverage draft genome assembly of the chimaera small-eyed rabbitfish, Hydrolagus affinis. We show that cartilaginous fish retain an archetypal NR gene repertoire, similar to that of mammals and coincident with the two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred in the gnathostome ancestor. Furthermore, novel gene members of the non-canonical NR0B receptors were found in the genomes of this lineage. Our findings provide an essential view into the early diversification of NRs in gnathostomes, paving the way for functional studies.
972	32525441	Diverse Activity Rhythms in Sharks (Elasmobranchii).	"Sharks are an interesting group of vertebrates, as many species swim continuously to ""ram"" oxygen-rich seawater over their gills (ram ventilators), whereas other species ""pump"" seawater over their gills by manipulating buccal cavity volume while remaining motionless (buccal pumpers). This difference in respiratory physiology raises the question: What are the implications of these differences in lifestyle for circadian rhythms? We investigated the diel activity patterns of 5 species of sharks, including 3 ram ventilating species: the school shark ("

The development of adaptive responses to novel situations via learning has been demonstrated in a wide variety of animal taxa. However, knowledge on the learning abilities of one of the oldest extant vertebrate groups, Chondrichthyes, remains limited. With the increasing interest in global wildlife tourism and shark feeding operations, it is important to understand the capacities of these animals to form associations between human activities and food. We used an operant conditioning regime with a simple spatial cognitive task to investigate the effects of reinforcement frequency and reward magnitude on the learning performance and memory retention of Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Twenty-four Port Jackson sharks were assigned one of four treatments differing in reward magnitude and reinforcement frequency (large magnitude-high frequency; large magnitude-low frequency; small magnitude-high frequency; small magnitude-low frequency). The sharks were trained over a 21-day period to compare the number of days that it took to learn to pass an assigned door to feed. Sharks trained at a high reinforcement frequency demonstrated faster learning rates and a higher number of passes through the correct door at the end of the trials, while reward magnitude had limited effects on learning rate. This suggests that a reduction in reinforcement frequency during tourism-related feeding operations is likely to be more effective in reducing the risk of sharks making associations with food than limiting the amount of food provided.
975	32516322	An evaluation of the public's Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) in Trinidad and Tobago regarding sharks and shark consumption.	There is a global lack of data concerning shark consumption trends, consumer attitudes, and public knowledge regarding sharks. This is the case in Trinidad and Tobago, where shark is a popular culinary delicacy. A Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted in Trinidad and Tobago. Six hundred and seven questionnaires were administered. Univariate and stepwise multivariate logistic regressions were performed to test the association between KAP and demographic categories. The response rate was 93.4% with 567 questionnaires returned (473 from Trinidad and 94 from Tobago). Two hundred and seventeen (38.3%) participants were knowledgeable, 422 (74.4%) displayed attitudes in favour of shark conservation and sustainable use, and 270 (47.6%) displayed practices promoting shark conservation and sustainable use. Island (AOR = 2.81, CI = 1.78, 4.46) and tertiary education (AOR = 2.31, CI = 1.20, 4.46) significantly influenced knowledge level. Gender (AOR = 1.50, CI = 1.02, 2.20) and island (AOR = 0.56, CI = 0.35, 0.90) significantly influenced attitude. Gender (COR = 1.59, CI = 1.14, 2.22) was significantly associated with practices. Over 70% of respondents ate shark, and 54.7% ate shark infrequently enough to avoid risks from heavy metal toxicity. Our results may be useful to develop public awareness and practice improvement initiatives in order to improve KAP regarding shark meat consumption.
976	32515875	The denticle surface of thresher shark tails: Three-dimensional structure and comparison to other pelagic species.	Shark skin denticles (scales) are diverse in morphology both among species and across the body of single individuals, although the function of this diversity is poorly understood. The extremely elongate and highly flexible tail of thresher sharks provides an opportunity to characterize gradients in denticle surface characteristics along the length of the tail and assess correlations between denticle morphology and tail kinematics. We measured denticle morphology on the caudal fin of three mature and two embryo common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus), and we compared thresher tail denticles to those of eleven other shark species. Using surface profilometry, we quantified 3D-denticle patterning and texture along the tail of threshers (27 regions in adults, and 16 regions in embryos). We report that tails of thresher embryos have a membrane that covers the denticles and reduces surface roughness. In mature thresher tails, surfaces have an average roughness of 5.6 μm which is smoother than some other pelagic shark species, but similar in roughness to blacktip, porbeagle, and bonnethead shark tails. There is no gradient down the tail in roughness for the middle or trailing edge regions and hence no correlation with kinematic amplitude or inferred magnitude of flow separation along the tail during locomotion. Along the length of the tail there is a leading-to-trailing-edge gradient with larger leading edge denticles that lack ridges (average roughness = 9.6 μm), and smaller trailing edge denticles with 5 ridges (average roughness = 5.7 μm). Thresher shark tails have many missing denticles visible as gaps in the surface, and we present evidence that these denticles are being replaced by new denticles that emerge from the skin below.
977	32515493	Myosin heavy chain isoforms in the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction of Scyliorhinus canicula (Chondrichthyes, Carcharhiniformes).	The atrioventricular junction of the fish heart, namely the segment interposed between the single atrium and the single ventricle, has been studied anatomically and histologically in several chondrichthyan and teleost species. Nonetheless, knowledge about myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in the atrioventricular myocardium remains scarce. The present report is the first one to provide data on the MyHC isoform distribution in the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction in chondrichthyans, specifically in the lesser spotted dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, a shark species whose heart reflects the primitive cardiac anatomical design in gnathostomes. Hearts from five dogfish were examined using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. The anti-MyHC A4.1025 antibody was used to detect differences in the occurrence of MyHC isoforms in the dogfish, as the fast-twitch isoforms MYH2 and MYH6 have a higher affinity for this antibody than the slow-twitch isoforms MYH7 and MYH7B. The histochemical findings show that myocardium of the atrioventricular junction connects the trabeculated myocardium of the atrium with the trabeculated layer of the ventricular myocardium. The immunohistochemical results indicate that the distribution of MyHC isoforms in the atrioventricular junction is not homogeneous. The atrial portion of the atrioventricular myocardium shows a positive reactivity against the A4.1025 antibody similar to that of the atrial myocardium. In contrast, the ventricular portion of the atrioventricular junction is not labelled, as is the case with the ventricular myocardium. This dual condition suggests that the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction has two contraction patterns: the myocardium of the atrial portion contracts in line with the atrial myocardium, whereas that of the ventricular portion follows the contraction pattern of the ventricular myocardium. Thus, the transition of the contraction wave from the atrium to the ventricle may be established in the atrioventricular segment because of its heterogeneous MyHC isoform distribution. The findings support the hypothesis that a distinct MyHC isoform distribution in the atrioventricular myocardium enables a synchronous contraction of inflow and outflow cardiac segments in vertebrates lacking a specialized cardiac conduction system.
978	32511057	How the parcellation theory of comparative forebrain specialization emerged from the Division of Neuropsychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.	The Golgi method gave birth to modern neuroscience. The Nauta method, developed in a novel Army think tank at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, was the next major breakthrough before neuroscience emerged as a separate discipline. Dr. Walle Nauta's (1916-1994) method allowed for the first time the ability to trace interneuronal connections accurately to their termination. The think tank, created by Dr. David Rioch (1900-1985), provided a unique intellectual environment for interdisciplinary neuroscience research, the first of its kind. Rioch hired exceptional senior faculty and recruited outstanding young investigators who were drafted into the Army, typically after finishing their M.D.s or Ph.D.s, and were interested in brain research. Many of these young investigators went on to illustrious careers in neuroscience. I worked with Walle Nauta at a time when the technique was first being applied to nonmammalian vertebrate brains. Along with other Army draftees, I was encouraged to pursue my own research interests. This led me on a quest to understand interspecific variability of connections in relation to evolution and ontogeny of the brain. By 1980, I had found that the variability of all known connections could be explained by a theory to the effect that new structures such as the neocortex were not formed by one system invading another and mingling, as Clarence Luther Herrick (1858-1904) had proposed, but by selective proliferation and differentiation sometimes involving the select loss of connections to reduce cross-modality interference as in the case of the parcellation and differentiation of cortical areas. The resulting parcellation theory predicts that elements of a primordial neocortex existed from the beginning of vertebrate evolution and did not originate by an invasion of nonolfactory modalities into the olfactory lobe, as commonly believed before the introduction of the Nauta method. This theory would not have been created if it were not for the brilliant environment that was Walter Reed in the 1960s.
979	32507218	Purification, characterisation and antioxidant activities of chondroitin sulphate extracted from Raja porosa cartilage.	This study was designed to isolate (isolation yield of 36.51 %) and characterise chondroitin sulphate (CS) from skate (Raja porosa) cartilage. Gel permeation chromatography demonstrated that the Raja porosa chondroitin sulphate (RPCS) obtained was a relatively uniform polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 40,752 Da and a purity of 94.0 %. Fourier-transform infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and strong anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that the content of the predominant GlcA-GalNAc6S unit in RPCS was 65.84 %, which was higher than that in shark CS (53.93 %). Furthermore, RPCS displayed more effective free radical scavenging effects than did shark CS, indicating the potential of RPCS to promote oxidative stress resistance and to act as an antioxidant agent. Skate cartilage could be exploited as a sufficient and sustainable source for the preparation of CS with higher 6S-sulphation, which in turn could be scaled up for use in the pharmaceutical industry.
980	32506537	Histomorphological and endocrine assessment of female Arabian carpetshark, Chiloscyllium arabicum (Elasmobranchii: Hemiscylliidae) from the Persian Gulf during annual reproductive cycle.	The present study aimed at assessing the annual reproductive cycle of female Arabian carpetshark, Chiloscyllium arabicum from the Persian Gulf by a macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the reproductive tract. The annual cycle of gonadal steroids [17β-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and testosterone (T)] was also assessed in this shark. In total, 130 female C. arabicum were collected from the Bahrakan Creek (located northwest of the Persian Gulf) between January 2018 and March 2019. Females were oviparous with an external-type ovary and only one functional ovary. Five sexual maturity stages were recognized based on macroscopic and microscopic evaluation: Immature I (August-October), Immature II (November-January), Mature (February-March), Pregnant (April-May) and Spent (June-July). The structural changes in the oviducts, oviducal glands and uterus throughout the annual reproductive cycle were consistent with their roles in the egg movement, the egg capsule production and sperm storage. The plasma levels of the gonadal steroids were associated with morphological changes in the reproductive tract. E2 showed two detectable peaks during March (close to ovulation) and June (just before mating). P4 and T displayed a peak just before ovulation.
981	32506516	Tube-like structures within the ovarian follicle of Hydrolagus colliei indicate the early origins of follicle cell processes.	Follicle cell processes (FCP) are actin-based, tube-like structures that connect the developing oocyte to the follicle cells throughout oogenesis. They were first described in Selachians (sharks) where their suggested roles were facilitating the transport of metabolites to the developing oocyte and providing structural support to the large egg cells of sharks, an early stage in the evolution of viviparity. Subsequent studies found that FCP are absent in Rajiformes (skates), suggesting that FCP may have been novel structures specific to the sharks. Here, FCP in Hydrolagus colliei, a Chimaeriform, were described. The FCP of H. colliei differ morphologically from those previously described in sharks, but as they also contain actin, they presumably play similar roles provisioning the developing oocyte and providing structural support. The presence of FCP in the order Chimaeriformes suggests that their origin predates the split of the elasmobranchs and the holocephalans.
982	32500233	Habitat-specific inter and intraspecific behavioral interactions among reef sharks.	Behavioral interactions such as dominance are critical components of animal social lives, competitive abilities, and resulting distribution patterns with coexisting species. Strong interference competition can drive habitat separation, but less is known of the role of interference if agonistic interactions are weak. While most theoretical models assume interference abilities to be constant in an environment, few consider that the extent of interference can vary by habitat and change model predictions. Using baited underwater cameras, we show a consistent dominance status between two sympatric reef sharks at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. Blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhyncos) relative abundance showed an inverse relationship to each other but the strength of this relationship varied by habitat. Reef shark relative abundance declined more rapidly in the presence of heterospecifics on forereef habitats as opposed to backreefs. In all habitats, gray reef sharks were more likely to bite bait cages than blacktips when both species were present, and appeared to be the dominant species. Intraspecific interactions were also apparent, with individual willingness to bite bait decreasing as the number of conspecifics increased. Gray reef sharks may exert differential control over blacktip foraging success in different habitats. Habitat-specific behavioral interactions may partially explain patterns of spatial separation between competing species where interference is weak.

Here, we evaluate maternal offloading of 16 trace elements (Essential: Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Se and Zn; Nonessential: Al, As, Ba, Cd, Hg, Pb, Tl and U) and determine mother-offspring isotopic fractionation of δ
984	32494601	Functional diversity of marine megafauna in the Anthropocene.	Marine megafauna, the largest animals in the oceans, serve key roles in ecosystem functioning. Yet, one-third of these animals are at risk of extinction. To better understand the potential consequences of megafaunal loss, here we quantify their current functional diversity, predict future changes under different extinction scenarios, and introduce a new metric [functionally unique, specialized and endangered (FUSE)] that identifies threatened species of particular importance for functional diversity. Simulated extinction scenarios forecast marked declines in functional richness if current trajectories are maintained during the next century (11% globally; up to 24% regionally), with more marked reductions (48% globally; up to 70% at the poles) beyond random expectations if all threatened species eventually go extinct. Among the megafaunal groups, sharks will incur a disproportionate loss of functional richness. We identify top FUSE species and suggest a renewed focus on these species to preserve the ecosystem functions provided by marine megafauna.
985	32492756	One panel to rule them all: DArTcap genotyping for population structure, historical demography, and kinship analyses, and its application to a threatened shark.	With recent advances in sequencing technology, genomic data are changing how important conservation management decisions are made. Applications such as Close-Kin Mark-Recapture demand large amounts of data to estimate population size and structure, and their full potential can only be realised through ongoing improvements in genotyping strategies. Here we introduce DArTcap, a cost-efficient method that combines DArTseq and sequence capture, and illustrate its use in a high resolution population analysis of Glyphis garricki, a rare, poorly known and threatened euryhaline shark. Clustering analyses and spatial distribution of kin pairs from four different regions across northern Australia and one in Papua New Guinea, representing its entire known range, revealed that each region hosts at least one distinct population. Further structuring is likely within Van Diemen Gulf, the region that included the most rivers sampled, suggesting additional population structuring would be found if other rivers were sampled. Coalescent analyses and spatially explicit modelling suggest that G. garricki experienced a recent range expansion during the opening of the Gulf of Carpentaria following the conclusion of the Last Glacial Maximum. The low migration rates between neighbouring populations of a species that is found only in restricted coastal and riverine habitats show the importance of managing each population separately, including careful monitoring of local and remote anthropogenic activities that may affect their environments. Overall we demonstrated how a carefully chosen SNP panel combined with DArTcap can provide highly accurate kinship inference and also support population structure and historical demography analyses, therefore maximising cost-effectiveness.
