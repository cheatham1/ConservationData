Textual data for IUCN Machine Learning Plastics Study

The purpose of this project is to increase understanding of the deeper messages inside the data on
plastic waste disposal and leakage in six Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in two ocean
regions â€“ the Caribbean (Saint Lucia, Grenada, and Antigua and Barbuda) and the Pacific (Fiji,
Vanuatu and Samoa).

Research conducted by Asia Pacific Waste Consultants (APWC) included desktop analysis,
extensive consultation with project stakeholders and in-country teams that undertook sampling,
auditing, interviews and stakeholder consultation sessions. The data produced by APWC in 2020 is
used in this study. The data is in excel and doc format.

Caribbean and Pacific Islands are particularly exposed and vulnerable to damage from plastic
leakage into marine and land-based ecosystems. Marine pollution is now ubiquitous in SIDS,
posing a serious threat to the marine ecosystems highly valued for tourism and fisheries as well as
the health and well-being of island communities. Addressing marine pollution is an ecological,
economic and social priority. The health of the ocean is intrinsically and inextricably linked to the
lives of the indigenous inhabitants of this region.
