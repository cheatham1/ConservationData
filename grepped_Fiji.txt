The potential for plastics recycling in Fiji is substantial and requires further investment.  In the past several years, Fiji has developed and is currently working on the implementation of a number of bans for single-use plastics, including thin plastic bags (< 50 microns), Styrofoam, single-use plastic containers, straws, cups and utensils. The recent Climate Change Bill 2019 has comprehensively addressed most of the disposable plastic items of environmental concern.  The national waste management budget is allocated by the Department of Environment, Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry of Health. These governmental entities have responsibility for solid waste management (SWM) in Fiji. The SWM budget in Fiji derives from several revenue streams, which include tipping fees (at three disposal sites), ECAL (plastic bag levy, taxes on luxury importation, certain services, income, etc.), licences (recycling, waste picking), littering fines and notices, and sales of compost and recyclables. The overall SWM expenditure includes staff salaries, equipment purchases and maintenance, landfill cost (operation and management), awareness programmes and clean-up campaigns. Overall, 140,000 tonnes of solid waste are disposed of in Fiji annually, of which around 15,000 tonnes are plastics. The tourism sector, particularly sea-based tourism (cruise and yacht activities), is a significant contributor to plastic waste (Figure 1). On daily basis, tourism land activities (hospitality) contribute 199 grams of plastic waste per tourist per day, which can be translated to six 1.5-litre plastic bottles per tourist per day.   Households dispose of 75,361 tonnes of waste per year, of which 5,876 tonnes are plastics. Commercial businesses dispose of 47,943 tonnes of waste per year, of which 6,881 tonnes are plastics. Overall, tourists generate 7 times more plastic waste per person per day than a Fijian resident does.  Land-based accommodation accounts for 94% of plastic waste disposal by the tourism sector. Fisheries-based consumable waste includes 5.4 tonnes of PET, 2 tonnes of PP and 0.8 tonnes of ‘other’ plastics. Plastics disposal contribution per sector During 2019, 14,875 tonnes of plastic was disposed of in Fiji. Disposal rates and composition of the waste by polymer types are demonstrated in the graphs below (Figure 2).  Plastic leakage  Overall, 24.7% (95% credible interval: 8.5%–40%) of imported plastic was leaked or held in long-term reservoirs away from landfill in Fiji, equating to 4,877 tonnes (Table 1).  Plastic leakage per sector  We assumed most plastic waste leaked from the commercial sector – almost 2,205 tonnes annually – followed by the household sector with 1,939 tonnes annually (Table 2).  Promote innovation and production of alternatives to single-use plastics and plastic packaging. Promote reusables and zero-waste consumption.  Plastic PET bottles containing water of 250 ml and 300 ml or less should be financially dis-incentivised through levies or taxes on plastic bottles or preform imports in order to encourage refillable water for local use. Seventy-five per cent (75%) of all plastic ever made has become waste (WTO, 2020). Plastic waste pollution presents numerous current and future challenges from design, production, consumption and disposal that must be tackled across the entire lifecycle of plastics. Most global efforts to mitigate plastic waste and identify leakage sources are focused on mainland countries, with little attention placed on Small Island Developing States (SIDS), whose cultures and economies greatly depend on the wealth of resources provided by oceans. The costs related to plastic pollution and climate-related impacts on SIDS are hugely disproportionate to the contribution of plastics.  Like other SIDS, Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are also vulnerable to the impacts of plastic leakage into marine and land-based ecosystems. Marine pollution is now ubiquitous in SIDS, posing a serious threat to the pristine marine ecosystems highly valued for tourism, fisheries and other valuable commodities, and significantly, the health and well-being of island communities. Addressing marine pollution is an ecological, economic and social priority, particularly in the Pacific region, which is extremely susceptible to the impacts of global marine pollution. The health of the ocean is intrinsically and inextricably linked to the lives of the indigenous inhabitants of the region. Apart from SIDS being affected by plastic pollution originating from faraway sources, considerable amounts of plastic waste are being produced in the islands as well. To close the global plastic waste pollution gap, with support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and the Didier and Martine Primat Foundation, IUCN launched the Plastic Waste Free Islands (PWFI) initiative in 2019. As part of its Close the Plastic Tap Programme, PWFI is a three-year initiative working in three regions: the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and the Pacific. The initiative’s overarching goal is to drive the circular economy agenda forward and to reduce plastic waste generation and leakage from islands. Marine plastic litter  Plastics leak into the ocean through a number of channels, including direct dumping of mismanaged or uncollected waste or land dumping that eventually makes its way to the marine environment (61% of total microplastic leakage). Waste collected formally and disposed of at landfills is also mismanaged, entering the marine environment via land, air or dumped illegally into waterways (39% of total microplastic leakage) (Pew Charitable Trust, 2020). Few studies have been conducted in Fiji to assess plastic pollution levels in the marine or land environment. In the most recent one available, Ferreira et al. (2020) found on average one plastic fragment in 4,000 litres of surface waters in Vanua Navakavu in the Suva area and 34 fragments per one kilogram of wet sediment in Laucala Bay. Of 120 fish examined, 67.5% contained microplastics, with some individuals having ingested more than 10 particles.  In relation to ocean-based sources of plastic pollution, a global meta-analysis study investigated fishing gear losses for different major gear types, estimating that 5.7% of all fishing nets, 8.6% of all traps and 29% of all lines are lost around the world each year (Richardson, Hardesty and Wilcox, 2019). A 2016 report predicted that by 2025 for every three tonnes of fish there will be one tonne of plastic waste in the ocean, so that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean (World Economic Forum et al., 2016). Plastic leakage  The accumulation of plastic waste in oceans from domestic, industrial and fishing activities is an emerging global issue. The increasing popularity of plastic, combined with low recycling rates, is increasing the amount of plastic leakage into the environment, with current global indications placing leakage at 3% or 12 million tonnes per year of the total plastic produced (IUCN, 2020). Project purpose The purpose of this project is to make a significant and quantified reduction in plastic waste disposal and leakage in six SIDS in two ocean regions – the Caribbean (Saint Lucia, Grenada and Antigua and Barbuda) and the Pacific (Fiji, Vanuatu and Samoa). The project aims to generate credible data and analysis to understand each country’s current plastic leakage status. This is calculated through a National Level Quantification of Plastic Waste and Sectorial Material Flow Analysis in three key sectors: tourism, fisheries, household and commercial and solid waste management. It supports waste reduction on the islands through analysis of entire value chains – from production to disposal – and of plastic usage and wastage across the different sectors. The plastic waste data mapping will track seven materials in an island-wide plastic influx and outflux format (including imports and exports at a national level) to identify sources, quantities and pathways of plastic waste generated and leaked per island, per sector. Data collection was supported by a stakeholder assessment, involving comprehensive interviews and discussions with plastic producers, users and other key stakeholders as shown in Figure 3. International agreements arise from the need to control pollution and its movement across national boundaries and to reduce the risk of harm to the environment and human health. A number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) relevant to waste management and pollution control have been ratified by Fiji (see Appendix J: Multilateral agreements). In 2004, Fiji ratified the Stockholm Convention; however, unlike Vanuatu and Samoa, Fiji has not ratified the Basel, Rotterdam and Minamata Conventions. Of particular importance is the SIDS Accelerated Modalities for Action (SAMOA) Pathway (2014), which addresses waste, chemicals and pollution issues in SIDS. On a regional level, Fiji is a party to the Apia Convention (1976), Noumea Convention (1986) and Noumea conventions Dumping Protocol (1990), and Waigani Convention (1996) (Figure 5). Plastic waste was included as hazardous waste in the Basel Convention in March 2019, and the Waigani Convention could potentially accept this decision as well.  Plastic bans In the last several years, Fiji has developed and amended a number of Acts addressing the top-priority plastic products associated with environmental degradation, such as plastic bags, polystyrene containers and other widely used disposable plastic products. In 2007, the Environment Management (Waste Disposal and Recycling) Regulations 2007 (Table 4), which describe various types of permits related to waste management and pollution, included a regulation on a plastic bottle permit (Reg. 30) for facilities that import or manufacture plastic bottles. This amendment was followed by the introduction of the container deposit regulation in 2011 (of the same Act), which also defines requirements for a product stewardship plan (PSP), deposit scheme and refund scheme. To date, deposit and refund schemes and product stewardship have yet to be implemented.  In 2015, another important environmental legislative document was developed (Environment and Climate Adaptation Levy) with its 2017 Regulations introducing a plastic bag levy. However, none of these regulations specifically banned plastic products until the Environment Management (Budget Amendment) Act 2019, which bans plastic bags, stating that it is an offence to manufacture, sell, supply or distribute plastic bags. This piece of legislation was further supported by the Climate Change Bill 2019, which bans single-use plastic bags, polystyrene and single-use containers, straws, cups and utensils. Clause 92 reads as follows: Reducing plastic pollution: 1 – Any business within the meaning of the Business Licensing Act 1976 that provides, sells or otherwise makes available single-use plastic bags after 1 January 2020 commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding FJD 750,000.  3 – Any business within the meaning of the Business Licensing Act 1976 that uses, provides, sells or otherwise makes available single-use plastic containers, straws, cups and utensils after 1 January 2021 commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to a fine not exceeding FJD 750,000. Finally, in 2020, polystyrene products were also banned through the Environment Management (Amendment) Act 2020. Additionally, the Ministry of Waterways and Environment provides a plastics permit since all importers of plastic are required to obtain the consent of the Department for the release of any plastic consignment into Fiji under Customs (Prohibited Imports and Exports) Regulations 2019. The plastic bag levy refers to thick plastic bags (> 50 microns), while the thin bags (< 50 microns) with handles are banned. The bag ban excludes thin plastic bags without handles, for fruit and vegetables, for example. The bag levy increased from the original 10 cents to 50 cents.  The Fiji Government provides annual subsidies of approximately USD 650,000, as tipping fees and household rates do not fully cover operating costs (PRIF, 2018). City and town councils charge waste collection and disposal fees at approximately FJD 1.7 per household per week, but often these fees are not paid. Under the Garbage Disposal By-Law (2009), the Suva City Council levies households with an annual fee of approximately USD 15 per bin to cover collection and disposal costs. Until August 2018, Rural Local Authorities had responsibility for SWM in rural areas. Councils now have responsibility to collect waste from rural and peri-urban populated areas, but the cost is subsidised by the government through the Ministry of Local Government. All government ministries make submissions on an annual basis to the Ministry of Economy for final approval and allocation of budget, which is finally endorsed after cabinet debate. For example, the Ministry of Economy considered a submission from DoE for a budget to improve and extend the new cell for Naboro Landfill, the plastic levy and ECAL. Lautoka City Council (LCC) has put a monitoring system in place to perform a cost-benefit analysis to justify more investment for SWM, for allocation of resources and to estimate the portions of the budget used for SWM activities (e.g. 20% in LCC).Plastics import, manufacturing and recycling in Fiji In 2018, Fiji imported plastic and rubber goods worth more than USD 145 million, predominantly from China and other Asian countries, Australia, New Zealand and Thailand (World Bank, 2021). Fiji exported almost USD 7 million of plastics and rubber mainly to Samoa, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, New Zealand and Vanuatu (World Bank, 2021). According to our estimates, the overall quantity of imported plastics in 2018 was 18,791 tonnes. The imports of plastic bags increased considerably from 2009 to 2012 but since this time the trend has been decreasing (PRIF, 2018), particularly in more recent years (Figure 6). The decrease in plastic bag imports is most likely the result of the recent plastics legislation, which has put further restrictions on the availability of plastic bags in the market.  Plastic producers There are several producers and suppliers in Fiji producing either plastic items and materials or goods packaged in plastics (see Appendix C: Project Methodology – Producers). The most common products are related to consumption, packaging or construction and engineering.  Plastic and waste initiatives and projects in Fiji Generally, there have been few waste and plastics projects on an international and regional level in Fiji. However, several national initiatives were carried out to raise awareness on plastic pollution, some of which took place before the development of plastic waste legislation. For example, the Suva City Council started an awareness campaign where Eco Bags were used to promote alternatives to plastic (SPREP, 2020). Similar projects took place in Nadi Council in 2010 and in Lautoka in 2011. The fast-tracking of Fiji’s plastics legislation and its leadership in COP 23 – the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Germany in 2017 and presided over by the government of Fiji – pays tribute to Fiji’s commitment to action on the dire global threat posed by plastic waste on marine and land environments. APWC recommends that any projects designed to improve future outcomes of these regulations should work closely with plastics projects (Table 6).  The recycling market in Fiji consists of six active private companies (Table 7), of which Waste Recyclers Fiji Pte Ltd (WRFL) has been the most reliable in offering recycling services across a broad range of products. The businesses are involved in the collection and export of waste materials but are often limited to a single line of materials. WRFL has been collecting and shipping out recyclables for more than 20 years, and larger hotels have contracts with WRFL to collect their recyclables (PET bottles, cartons, aluminium cans). Two important recycling businesses seem to be out of operation since 2020, most likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic (not included in Table 7). GreenWaste Recyclers Pte Ltd is currently dormant (out of operation), with a variety of materials stockpiled without immediate plans for export. The Mission Pacific Programme (operated by Coca-Cola Amatil as a corporate social responsibility public relations exercise, not a standalone/profitable recycling enterprise) has claimed to be in continuous operation for decades, but its website is currently offline, and the state of its operations is unclear. It seems that the pandemic measures have had an impact on export of recyclables, while on the contrary, the generation of plastic waste has increased considerably.  There are also plans to introduce a nationwide container deposit scheme for plastics to boost recycling in Fiji. At this stage, only Coca-Cola and Fiji Water (Mission Pacific) offer a return fee for PET bottles, exclusive to their own products. Other plastic bottles are also collected but no reimbursement is given. The collected bottles are then exported.  This dumpsite is located near Sigatoka and the sand dunes in the Nadroga-Navosa Province. There is one permanent staff member, one contractor and two waste pickers on site. The site is prone to windy conditions, which presents potential plastic leakage concerns into the surrounding environment.  Household and commercial sector – Plastic quantification results Unlike waste collection in urban areas, which seems to be quite efficient, collection in rural and remote areas of Fiji is problematic. As almost half Fiji’s population resides in rural areas, this creates a considerable potential for plastic leakage from rural areas. For example, of all the Lomaiviti and Lau islands, which count 9,602 and 15,657 residents, respectively (FBS, 2018), only Levuka town on the island of Ovalau (Lomaiviti) has a waste collection service. Nevertheless, there are some rural communities, such as Rakiraki town (Zariff, 2006), without a designated disposal site, where the Rural Local Authorities have organised waste collection for residential and commercial properties. Collectors charge for these services, although on a no-profit basis.  The great majority of waste in urban Fiji is collected. As mentioned above, most remote and rural communities still do not have access to adequate waste services. However, waste disposal in densely populated rural areas of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu improved dramatically in 2018 when councils extended waste collection service outside of urban areas. Dumping of waste into creeks and rivers has decreased considerably. Lautoka City Council, for example, collects approximately 100 tonnes of waste per month generated by about 20,000 people from rural areas (equivalent to a disposal rate of 0.17 kg/person/day) (pers. comm. Shalend Singh). Since burning and backyard burial are still common practice, a proportion of plastic waste is still disposed of in this manner, by both households and commercial premises (Figure 15).  In 2020, the overall household and commercial waste disposal rate in Fiji equalled 123,304 tonnes per year. Organic waste was the most common waste type (40.3%), consisting mainly of food scraps, plant material from gardening, old baskets and other biodegradable natural materials (Figure 17). The second most common material category was paper and cardboard, contributing 16.1%, followed by plastics (10.4%) and metals (10.1%). It should be noted that many of the hygiene products, textiles, e-waste and construction materials are either entirely or partially composed of synthetic polymers, meaning the proportion of plastics in Fiji household and commercial waste is in fact greater than 10.7%. However, to ensure the analysis was accurate for pure polymer types, these categories were kept separate from other plastics. For a more detailed breakdown of all categories, please see Appendix D: Material types and sort form. Unlike other countries included in the PWFI study, it was not possible to obtain visual landfill sort records in Fiji. This raised a significant challenge for estimating the total quantity of plastic disposed of. In order to estimate the composition of Fiji waste, we assumed the quantities of waste were generated annually in Fiji and not captured in bagged waste data in Table 11.  Disposal rates generated by the household sector are generally higher than the commercial sector. We estimated that Fiji households disposed of 75,361 tonnes of waste per year, while the commercial sector disposed of 47,943 tonnes per year. Almost half (48%) of all household waste is organics (36,216 T/y) (Figure 18). The most common commercial waste is also organics (13,104 T/y; 27%), followed by paper and cardboard (11,958 T/y; 26%). In households, plastics comprise 8% (5,876 T/y) of all waste, while in the commercial sector, plastic waste contributes almost 15% (6,881 T/y) to all waste.  Plastic waste disposal and leakage According to the polymer type, the most prevalent plastic waste disposed of in Fiji is made from various polymers categorised as ‘Plastics Other’ (Figure 19). This presents a serious challenge for current recycling efforts, as plastics of this category are most often non-recyclable. The commercial sector generally produces more plastic waste than household premises (Table 12).  Top 10 plastic items Of all plastic items disposed of by households and commercial premises, the most common items are soft plastic packaging and various single-use plastics. Almost all top 10 items could be classified as single-use plastics, which is also why they are the most prevalent waste type – they are used only once (Table 13). These items are also predominantly related to food and beverage consumption.  Note, hygiene products were not included in the top 10 items. However, if these had been included, nappies (diapers) would top the household plastic items (91%), and feminine hygiene products would be fifth (6%). In the commercial sector, nappies would be item number three (15%) and feminine hygiene number six (6%).  Note: The percentages refer to the proportion of these items in all plastic waste in the sector. Plastic waste leakage  According to our model estimates, around 1,939 tonnes per year of household waste and 2,205 tonnes per year of commercial plastic waste leaked into the environment in 2020 (Table 14).  A drastic reduction in the production and use of plastics, particularly single-use plastic items and packaging, is the absolute priority when it comes to plastic pollution management. There are multiple ways to avoid the generation of plastic waste, including the following: Bans on single-use plastic items, such as plastic bags, cups, cutlery, plates, straws, takeaway containers, which incontrovertibly cause environmental pollution. Innovations and production of alternatives to single-use plastics and plastic packaging, as well as promotion of reusable and zero-waste consumption. Special attention should be given to the ’false’ solutions to plastic pollution and the ‘green washing’ alternatives. The audit identified gaps and recommendations on plastic and solid waste reduction and management, from upstream to downstream of waste management, which are presented below (Table 15).   Tourism sector – Plastic quantification results The Coral Coast chapter of the Fiji Hotel and Tourism Association has called on the government to establish a plastic recycling facility in the country and urged it to implement a refundable deposit on all plastic bottles.   There is currently a user-pays system in place for 12 participating hotels working with local private waste recyclers. These hotels include the Tanoa group, Novotel, Mercure, Laucala Island, Kokomo, Hilton, Tokatoka, Hideaway, Naviti, Yatule, Gecko’s and Waterfront. Recyclable items are accepted for a fee (see Table 17) including paper, cardboard, plastic, aluminium cans, tin cans, glass bottles, PET bottles, preforms, PET bottle lids, LDPE and HDPE. Hotels separate recyclables from general waste, which is collected by Waste Recyclers Fiji and sorted at their Navutu yard. Aluminium cans provided to the recycler are reimbursed at a rate of 0.80 FJD  per kilogram and Paradise beverage company glass bottles at FJD 1.00 per crate. The user-pays system is driven entirely by the recycler. A dedicated sales and marketing employee approaches all resorts and businesses to promote the benefits of recycling. The waste from international and domestic airports and airlines is the responsibility of Fiji Airports Limited. At Fiji’s international airports, Nadi and Nausori, airline- and airport-generated waste is managed separately, with the offloaded waste from airlines designated quarantine in nature. All quarantine waste must be incinerated under requirements set by biosecurity. Both Nausori and Nadi have an onsite incinerator for this purpose. Waste generated at airports is sorted and recycled. At Nausori, paper, plastic bottles and aluminium cans are sorted and recycled by local recycling contractors, with the remaining non-recyclable waste taken to Naboro Landfill by Waste Care Fiji. At Nadi airport, waste is also sorted and recycling items are taken to a local recycling contractor; non-recyclable items are transported to Vunato Landfill in Lautoka. Under current international and Fiji legislation, food waste is the only allowable waste to be dumped in the ocean from yachts (which must be approximately 20 kilometres or 12 miles or more from land). Disposal of all other waste is prohibited and must be retained on board and discharged at shore reception facilities. Disposal of plastics at sea is prohibited under both international regulations (MARPOL 73/78) and Fiji national law (Maritime Transport Decree 2013). The Fiji Maritime Transport Decree 2013 states that any ship (including yachts) within Fiji waters may discharge food waste, paper, rags, glass, metal, bottles and crockery if:  Most waste in the tourism sector is collected (Figure 23). It should be noted that the 14.3% of plastic dumped in the water is actually based on one response only.  The overall quantity of waste disposed of by the tourism industry in Fiji was estimated to be approximately 16,211 tonnes per year. The most prevalent waste category by a large margin is organic waste, comprising 61% of all waste (9,859 T/y) (Figure 24). The second most common category is paper and cardboard (2,190 T/y; 13.5%), followed by plastics (2,117 T/y; 13.1%).  Tourists visiting Fiji are responsible for the largest overall share of disposed waste and the largest proportion of plastics. The amount of waste generated by cruise ships was calculated by assuming that each cruise ship carried approximately the same waste quantities and composition as reported in the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, where a visual audit of cruise waste was conducted (see PWFI APWC Antigua and Barbuda report). In comparison to Antigua’s 733,526 annual tourist cruise arrivals, Fiji saw an average of 239,270 cruise arrivals in 2019. Audits of yacht waste from Antigua and Saint Lucia were also used to estimate the composition of yacht waste in Fiji. There were 4,473 yacht passengers arriving in Fiji??? in 2019.  Plastic waste disposal and leakage The overall disposal of plastic waste by the tourism sector in Fiji equals 2,117 tonnes per year. The largest amounts of plastics were disposed of by the land-based tourism subsector (Table 22). Regarding the polymer type, besides the category Plastics Other (7) that includes various polymers, the most common are PET, LDPE and PS.  Top 10 plastic items The most common plastic items found in land tourism waste are foamed polystyrene food containers (Styrofoam takeaway containers), contributing almost 50% to all plastic waste, followed by water bottles and soft plastic packaging (Table 23).  Plastic waste leakage We estimated that the tourism sector leaks more than 733 tonnes of plastic waste (Table 24) into the environment or disposes of it improperly (burning, burying, etc). If we suppose that the tourism sector leaks plastic at the same rates as Vanuatu overall, it will produce the quantities per polymer type as provided in Table 25.   There are few reliable sources for the rate of waste generation (as opposed to disposal) by cruise ships, which makes it difficult to estimate how much waste is leaked. CE Delft 2017 performed audits on waste logs of a variety of ships, including cruise ships, and provided estimates of the volume of waste produced per passenger, although these estimates are very imprecise. After accounting for uncertainty in waste disposal from our data and overall generation rates from CE Delft 2017, the median estimate for leakage or incineration of plastics was 51.5%. As it was not possible to obtain a precise figure for the rate of waste generation, our data are consistent with cruise-ship leakage rates anywhere from 0% to 91%. A drastic reduction in the production and use of plastics, particularly single-use plastic items and packaging, is the absolute priority when it comes to plastic pollution management. There are multiple ways to avoid the generation of plastic waste, including the following: PET bottles – policy should be developed to require large hotels and resorts to provide mandatory water refilling stations for guests with reusable bottles. Plastic PET bottles under 500 millilitres in size should be included in the ban. The audit identified gaps and recommendations on plastic and solid waste reduction and management, from upstream to downstream of waste management, which are presented below (Table 25).   The gear used by the Fijian offshore longline sector is standard pelagic longline gear used to target tuna (Figure 29, left panel). The gear consists of a thick mainline with snoods (or branch lines) attached at regular intervals by stainless steel clips. Lines are suspended using plastic floats, with the distance between the floats regulating the depth at which hooks are set. Up to three radio buoys are attached to the line to track location. Mainlines are typically monofilament nylon; branch lines are typically monofilament but may also include synthetic twine (Figure 29, right panel). Clips and hooks are stainless steel. Typically, between 3,000 and 3,500 hooks are used per set. Plastic and fisheries  Figure 31 below gives an overview of the purse-seine and longline fishing industry in the Pacific and gives an indication and context of how much plastic fishing gear is used in Fijian waters. As plastic purse-seine nets can reach more than 2,000 metres in length and 200 metres in depth, this is a significant amount of plastic fishing gear that has the potential to become ALDFG. Other typical plastic fishing gear includes rope, fishing nets and lines, in addition to fishing vessels made of materials such as fibreglass, and plastic antifouling products. Common plastics in fishing gear Pollution from fishing vessels is a serious problem in the WCPO, particularly from purse-seine vessels. It was estimated that 71% of the purse-seine pollution incidents were documented as waste dumped overboard, and only 13% as ALDFG (Richardson et al., 2017). Of the ‘waste dumped’ overboard, 60% was found to be plastics in longline activities (Figure 33) and 37% in purse-seine activities (Figure 33). Furthermore, 30% of pollution incidents reported by observers occurred within Fiji’s EEZ, and 21% of pollution incidents observed on longline vessels were between Fijian-flagged vessels (Richardson et al., 2017). (Note: This could result from a higher number of observers being present on Fijian vessels.) Plastic materials other than fishing gear A majority of domestic fishing vessels in Fiji engaged in same-day or overnight fishing operations, with operators taking subsistence items such as food, water and drink containers on board. Vessels engaged in multi-day operations are more likely to take plastic items such as food packaging (for example, bags with rice, pasta, sugar, drink mix, salt and other seasonings) and food, water and drink containers. Other plastic-containing materials include buckets, life jackets, flares and sounding equipment. Maritime Transport Act 2013 and associated regulations – the discharge of plastics, dunnage, lining and packing materials within Fiji waters (excluding a port or approaches to a port) is an infringement offence with the maximum fine being FJD 2,000 if the ship from which the discharge has been made is less than 15 metres in length, and FJD 10,000 if the ship is more than 15 metres in length. APWC interviews indicate that most waste generated by fisher folk is collected (Figure 34). Due to a low number of interviewees, these results are not statistically strong enough to reflect the true situation on the ground. For example, only one boat crew interviewed stated that it burned plastic, and one stated that waste was buried. Burning occurs most likely in on-board incinerators as shown on Figure 35a. On some occasions, waste is also separated on board (Figure 35b).  There are 93 fishing vessels reported to be active in Fiji waters, taking an estimated 6,975 trips each year. Waste audits indicated that each fishing trip was associated with 0.09 kilogram of offloaded waste. It was estimated that the fisheries sector disposes of around 42.3 tonnes of solid waste annually, of which 22% or 9.3 tonnes are various plastics. The most dominant category is hazardous waste (48%) (Figure 37), consisting of batteries. Battery type was not specified but we assume these are batteries from torches used to attract fish. Possibly the main reason for the dominance of this category is the high weight of batteries.  Plastic waste disposal The amount of plastic waste generated by the fisheries sector is 9.3 tonnes per year. The most common polymer types are PET 1 (58%) and polypropylene (PP 5) (21.5%) (Figure 38). The Top 10 plastic items table shows that most waste disposed of by the fisheries sector is not related to fishing activities but to consumption of food and beverages (Table 28). These items should be classified as ocean-based pollution when dumped at sea, even though they are not directly linked to marine activities (fishing, sailing, petrochemical exploration). However, it is a practice that consumption-related items recovered in beach and seafloor assessments are associated with land-based activities. This exemplifies the possible underestimation of the proportion of ocean-based pollution in plastic pollution assessments.            Plastic waste leakage Plastic waste leakage in the fisheries sector was calculated in two ways:   Plastic waste leakage based on field data collected as per the audit methodology. This is waste generated by fisher folk when they are undertaking fishing-related activities, from personal use.  Plastic waste leakage desktop study, where leakage calculations are based on assumptions derived from a desktop study literature review (peer reviewed studies from 1978–2021) by Richardson et al. (2019). These estimations are not linked to physical in-country auditing. Plastic waste leakage based on the waste audit If plastic leakage from fishing vessels is at the same rate as other examined sectors, the average annual leakage (for 2019) is given in Table 29. The polymer type leaked at the highest rate from fisher folk during fishing seems to be PET.  Plastic leakage in the form of fishing gear (ALDFG) – desktop study The calculations show that in both the Pacific and Caribbean regions overall, nylon material (Other 7) in fishing gear is the most frequently leaked polymer of all fishing gear (85%), followed by HDPE (5%), plastics other than nylon (2%) and PVC (less than 1%). A breakdown of polymer type and gear type is shown in the table below. Each country provided import data linked to Customs HS codes related to plastic material in fishing gear. In 2019, the countries in focus imported approximately 195.64 tonnes of fishing gear containing plastic components; Fiji was accountable for 33% of all imports. It is important to note, however, that 19% of the import data is missing, as this was not received on request.  Drastic reduction in the production and use of plastics, particularly single-use plastic items and packaging as well as prevention of the loss of fishing gear, is the absolute priority when it comes to plastic pollution management. There are multiple ways to avoid the generation of plastic waste, as can be seen in the table below. Plastic flow analysis Marine plastic pollution Asari et al. (2019) estimated that PICs contribute to global mismanaged plastic waste with 1.3% to 2.7% and, depending on the scenario, ranging between 156,000 and 327,000 tonnes per year. The authors proposed the potential reasons for leakage to be relatively low waste collection rates in rural areas and the high generation rates of plastic waste.  Plastic waste generation and disposal in Fiji Plastic and other solid waste disposal in Fiji is quite low, particularly in the household, commercial and fisheries sectors (Figure 39). Overall, SWM in Fiji is slightly better than in Samoa and Vanuatu, however since there is a large gap in the waste service coverage in remote and rural areas, pollution potential is still considerably high. With respect to plastic waste generation, expressing the amounts in weight (grams or kilograms) gives the impression that negligible amounts of plastic waste are disposed of on daily basis. For example, data show that on average, a Fijian resident disposes of around 20 grams of plastic per day in household waste. If an empty 600-millilitre plastic bottle (Islam et al., 2018) weighs about the same amount, this would mean that the 883,483 residents in Fiji dispose of the amount of plastic that equals 883,483 bottles in just one day. Extrapolated to a year, that is equivalent to more than 322 million plastic bottles from this one sector alone. The hospitality industry generally creates large amounts of waste, particularly disposable plastics, and in Fiji, we estimated that the disposal intensities are eight times higher than in households.  Figure 39: General (a) and plastic (b) waste disposal intensity in Fiji across all sectors of our interest. Note that measurement units vary The overall plastic waste disposal rate across all the sectors – household, commercial, tourism and fisheries, has been estimated at almost 15,000 tonnes or 83,000 cubic metres per year. The commercial sector disposed of the most plastic waste annually, generating more than 6,800 tonnes per year and almost 40,000 cubic metres of plastic waste annually (Figure 40).  With respect to the polymer type, the most common plastics disposed of are the Plastics Other (7) category, which is generally non-recyclable (Figure 41). In the commercial sector, this category comprises more than half of all plastic waste. Category ‘Other’ is followed by PET, PP and LDPE, which are highly recyclable and have reasonably good market value.  Top 10 plastic items The most common items found in plastic waste disposed of in Fiji are water bottles made of PET (1) and soft plastic packaging, amongst others. The majority of items listed are disposable, single-use plastics. The current bans address only some items, and exclude the soft plastic packaging and water bottles, which are the most numerous. If hygiene products were considered, nappies (diapers), tampons and pads would represent 2.5%, making it the top plastic item.  Plastic leakage across sectors In common with other PICs, plastic leakage in Fiji occurs in rural areas and outer islands, where waste collection services are often scarce or non-existent. The problem is compounded by lack of adequate or designated areas for waste disposal. As a consequence, dumping, burying and burning of waste is common, which exacerbates potential plastic leakage into the environment.  To determine the amount of domestic plastic waste produced each year, we aggregated customs data for imports of raw plastics, food and drink items, and manufactured plastic items. For each item imported, we estimated a lifespan and the percentage of the imported weight consisting of plastic that would likely end up as waste. The total waste generation was taken from customs records provided to APWC, which also enabled the estimation of the percentage of waste going to the managed landfill at Naboro compared with the waste going to semi-managed and unmanaged dumpsites elsewhere. Waste composition was determined from the bagged waste composition along with projections of certain categories of bulky waste based on audits of other countries. The need to use projections here increased the uncertainty in leakage estimates when making comparisons with previously audited countries. different categorisation of plastics in the import and waste streams Our estimate of leakage was based on a Bayesian model, which took as input total waste generation and imports for each polymer. It was assumed that the true rate of leakage for each polymer was close to the overall leakage rate, and that waste disposal figures may have a 15 % systematic error and import figures a 10% systematic error in addition to sampling error and year-to-year variation. These assumptions allow us to use the overall rate of leakage to provide more credible estimates for each individual polymer. (See Appendix I for details of the model.) Overall, it was estimated that 24.7% (95% credible interval: 8.5%–40%) or 4,880 tonnes of imported plastic was leaked or held in long-term reservoirs, most of which leaked from commercial sector activities (Table 38).  Some of the plastic leakage mechanisms identified in Fiji include: Animal scattering of plastics from garbage bags that still occurs regularly  Wind-blowing of plastics from the landfill into the surrounding environment (e.g. Sigatoka landfill) Plastic leakage from construction sites Plastic leakage per polymer type Material flow analysis of plastic waste generated and disposed of in Fiji shows that leakage is much lower than in other surveyed locations. More than 70% of plastic waste is going to landfill and less than 1% is exported or recycled (Figure 42). Plastics categories with the highest leakage potential are Plastics Other (7), PVC (3) and PS (6) (Figure 43).  Fiji banned single-use plastic bags in January 2020. A ban on importing and manufacturing polystyrene (Styrofoam) containers was introduced in January 2021. Our waste audit indicated that Fiji had a larger than usual quantity of polystyrene products in the waste stream (Table 39), which may be related to the presence of an important polystyrene manufacturer in Fiji (Manubhai Industries). However, apart from polystyrene takeaway containers, the substantial quantities of polystyrene imports could be related to the production of construction goods, which have a long lifespan from manufacture to disposal, and will not enter the waste stream for a number of years. We therefore considered imports of raw polystyrene (but not finished products) to have a life of 30 years. Although plastic bans in Fiji are reasonably new, there is noticeable consumer behavioural change, with the demand for more environmentally-acceptable alternatives on the rise (Figure 44). Although not reusable, paper straws are more regularly used in cafes and restaurants (pers. comm. Shalend Singh).
