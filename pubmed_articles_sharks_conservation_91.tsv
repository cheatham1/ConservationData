1	36182787	Total mercury concentrations in sharks, skates and rays along the South African coast.	Global declines in elasmobranch populations resulting from several stressors raises conservation concern. Additionally, apex predators bioaccumulate high concentrations of total mercury (THg), due to biomagnification. Although South Africa is considered one of the top ten contributors of Hg emissions globally, information on Hg concentrations in elasmobranchs is limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the THg concentrations in 22 species of elasmobranchs along the South African coastline. Concentrations ranged between 0.22 and 5.8 mg/kg in Haploblepharus pictus (dark shysharks) and Rostroraja alba (white skates) on the south coast, respectively. Along the east coast it ranged between 0.21 and 17.8 mg/kg in Mobula kuhlii (shortfin devil rays) and Sphyrna lewini (scalloped hammerheads), respectively. Mercury concentrations on the east coast were in the same range or higher compared to the same species sampled between 2005-10 from the same region, with generally higher concentrations compared to the same species sampled globally.
2	36178940	A multi-method characterization of Elasmobranch & Cheloniidae communities of the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba.	The Red Sea is particularly biodiverse, hosting high levels of endemism and numerous populations whose extinction risk is heightened by their relative isolation. Elasmobranchs and sea turtles have likely suffered recent declines in this region, although data on their distribution and biology are severely lacking, especially on the eastern side of the basin in Saudi Arabian waters. Here, we present sightings of elasmobranchs and sea turtles across the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba collected through a combination of survey methods. Over 455 survey hours, we recorded 407 sightings belonging to 26 elasmobranch species and two sea turtle species, more than 75% of which are of conservation concern. We identified 4 species of rays and 9 species of sharks not previously recorded in Saudi Arabia and report a range extension for the pink whipray (Himantura fai) and the round ribbontail ray (Taeniurops meyeni) into the Gulf of Aqaba. High density of sightings of conservation significance, including green and hawksbill sea turtles and halavi guitarfish were recorded in bay systems along the eastern Gulf of Aqaba and the Saudi Arabian coastline bordering the north-eastern Red Sea, and many carcharhinid species were encountered at offshore seamounts in the region. Our findings provide new insights into the distribution patterns of megafaunal assemblages over smaller spatial scales in the region, and facilitate future research and conservation efforts, amidst ongoing, large-scale coastal developments in the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba.
3	36175455	Assessing a megadiverse but poorly known community of fishes in a tropical mangrove estuary through environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding.	Biodiversity surveys are crucial for monitoring the status of threatened aquatic ecosystems, such as tropical estuaries and mangroves. Conventional monitoring methods are intrusive, time-consuming, substantially expensive, and often provide only rough estimates in complex habitats. An advanced monitoring approach, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, is promising, although only few applications in tropical mangrove estuaries have been reported. In this study, we explore the advantages and limitations of an eDNA metabarcoding survey on the fish community of the Merbok Estuary (Peninsular Malaysia). COI and 12S eDNA metabarcoding assays collectively detected 178 species from 127 genera, 68 families, and 25 orders. Using this approach, significantly more species have been detected in the Merbok Estuary over the past decade (2010-2019) than in conventional surveys, including several species of conservation importance. However, we highlight three limitations: (1) in the absence of a comprehensive reference database the identities of several species are unresolved; (2) some of the previously documented specimen-based diversity was not captured by the current method, perhaps as a consequence of PCR primer specificity, and (3) the detection of non-resident species-stenohaline freshwater taxa (e.g., cyprinids, channids, osphronemids) and marine coral reef taxa (e.g., holocentrids, some syngnathids and sharks), not known to frequent estuaries, leading to the supposition that their DNA have drifted into the estuary through water movements. The community analysis revealed that fish diversity along the Merbok Estuary is not homogenous, with the upstream more diverse than further downstream. This could be due to the different landscapes or degree of anthropogenic influences along the estuary. In summary, we demonstrated the practicality of eDNA metabarcoding in assessing fish community and structure within a complex and rich tropical environment within a short sampling period. However, some limitations need to be considered and addressed to fully exploit the efficacy of this approach.
4	36165921	Energetic consequences of resource use diversity in a marine carnivore.	Understanding how intraspecific variation in the use of prey resources impacts energy metabolism has strong implications for predicting long-term fitness and is critical for predicting population-to-community level responses to environmental change. Here, we examine the energetic consequences of variable prey resource use in a widely distributed marine carnivore, juvenile sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus). We used carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify three primary prey resource pools-demersal omnivores, pelagic forage, and benthic detritivores and estimated the proportional assimilation of each resource using Bayesian mixing models. We then quantified how the utilization of these resource pools impacted the concentrations of six plasma lipids and how this varied by ontogeny. Sharks exhibited variable reliance on two of three predominant prey resource pools: demersal omnivores and pelagic forage. Resource use variation was a strong predictor of energetic condition, whereby individuals more reliant upon pelagic forage exhibited higher blood plasma concentrations of very low-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These findings underscore how intraspecific variation in resource use may impact the energy metabolism of animals, and more broadly, that natural and anthropogenically driven fluctuations in prey resources could have longer term energetic consequences.
5	36088355	Sharkipedia: a curated open access database of shark and ray life history traits and abundance time-series.	A curated database of shark and ray biological data is increasingly necessary both to support fisheries management and conservation efforts, and to test the generality of hypotheses of vertebrate macroecology and macroevolution. Sharks and rays are one of the most charismatic, evolutionary distinct, and threatened lineages of vertebrates, comprising around 1,250 species. To accelerate shark and ray conservation and science, we developed Sharkipedia as a curated open-source database and research initiative to make all published biological traits and population trends accessible to everyone. Sharkipedia hosts information on 58 life history traits from 274 sources, for 170 species, from 39 families, and 12 orders related to length (n = 9 traits), age (8), growth (12), reproduction (19), demography (5), and allometric relationships (5), as well as 871 population time-series from 202 species. Sharkipedia relies on the backbone taxonomy of the IUCN Red List and the bibliography of Shark-References. Sharkipedia has profound potential to support the rapidly growing data demands of fisheries management, international trade regulation as well as anchoring vertebrate macroecology and macroevolution.
6	36074239	Elasmobranchs from Indonesian Waters: Feeding Ecology and Trypanorhynch Cestode Fauna Composition to Support Efforts in Shark and Ray Conservation.	"PURPOSE: The stomachs and spiral valves of sharks and rays were examined for their trypanorhynch (Cestoda) parasite fauna and dietary items to infer feeding ecology. In Indonesia, sharks and rays have been experiencing increasing awareness and conservation in the recent years due to high fisheries activities and to avoid future species extinction.
METHODS: The samples were collected in 2009 from two different sampling sites at the southern coasts of Java and Bali in Indonesia. The parasite fauna was studied for 41 elasmobranch fishes. Amongst these, three shark species, Carcharhinus sorrah, Carcharhinus sp. I and Squalus megalops and seven ray species, Brevitrygon heterura, B. cf. heterura, Gymnura zonura, Maculabatis gerrardi, Mobula kuhlii, Neotrygon cauruleopuncatata and Rhinobatos penggali were studied. Four additional specimens, belonging to the shark species Carcharhinus sp. II and Mustelus cf. manazo and the ray species Maculabatis gerrardi were studied from the waters of South Bali.
RESULTS: Analyses of the feeding ecology of the ray M. gerrardi revealed distinct differences between both sampling sites, indicating the presence of ecological differences between the geographically independent regions. A total of 11 different trypanorhynch species/taxa belonging to the five families Eutetrarhynchidae (5), Gilquiniidae (1), Lacistorhynchidae (1), Pterobothriidae (1) and Tentaculariidae (3) were found. Ten trypanorhynch species from Penyu Bay and four species from South Bali could be identified. Two taxa that might represent new species were collected: Dollfusiella sp. from Brevitrygon heterura and Prochristianella sp. from Maculabatis gerrardi.
CONCLUSIONS: The present paper gives insights in using the trypanorhynch cestode community in combination with feeding ecology analyses to support conservation of elasmobranchs in Indonesian waters."
7	36056454	Vertical space use and thermal range of the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), (Rüppell, 1837) in the western North Atlantic.	The great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) is a highly mobile, large-bodied shark primarily found in coastal-pelagic and semi-oceanic waters across a circumtropical range. It is a target or by-catch species in multiple fisheries, and as a result, rapid population declines have occurred in many regions. These declines have contributed to the species being assessed as globally critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. Although conservation and management measures have yielded promising results in some regions, such as the United States, high levels of at-vessel and post-release mortality remain a major concern to the species population recovery. This examined the vertical space use and thermal range of pop-off archival satellite-tagged S. mokarran in the western North Atlantic Ocean, expanding the understanding of the ecological niche of this species and providing insight into by-catch mitigation strategies for fisheries managers. The results showed that S. mokarran predominantly used shallow depths (75% of records <30 m) and had a narrow temperature range (89% of records between 23 and 28°C). Individual differences in depth use were apparent, and a strong diel cycle was observed, with sharks occupying significantly deeper depths during the daytime. Furthermore, two individuals were confirmed pregnant with one migrating from the Bahamas to South Carolina, U.S.A., providing further evidence of regional connectivity and parturition off the U.S. East Coast. The findings suggest that S. mokarran may be vulnerable to incidental capture in the western North Atlantic commercial longline fisheries due to substantial vertical overlap between the species and the gear. The results can be incorporated into conservation and management efforts to develop and/or refine mitigation measures focused on reducing the by-catch and associated mortality of this species, which can ultimately aide S. mokarran population recovery in areas with poor conservation status.
8	36052296	Age group DNA methylation differences in lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris): Implications for future age estimation tools.	Age information is often non-existent for most shark populations due to a lack of measurable physiological and morphological traits that can be used to estimate age. Recently, epigenetic clocks have been found to accurately estimate age for mammals, birds, and fish. However, since these clocks rely, among other things, on the availability of reference genomes, their application is hampered in non-traditional model organisms lacking such molecular resources. The technique known as Methyl-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) has emerged as a valid alternative for studying DNA methylation biomarkers when reference genome information is missing, and large numbers of samples need to be processed. Accordingly, the MSAP technique was used in the present study to characterize global DNA methylation patterns in lemon sharks from three different age groups (juveniles, subadults, and adults). The obtained results reveal that, while MSAP analyses lack enough resolution as a standalone approach to infer age in these organisms, the global DNA methylation patterns observed using this technique displayed significant differences between age groups. Overall, these results confer that DNA methylation does change with age in sharks like what has been seen for other vertebrates and that MSAP could be useful as part of an epigenetics pipeline to infer the broad range of ages found in large samples sizes.
9	35963405	Size distribution patterns of silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis shaped by environmental factors in the Pacific Ocean.	Commercial fisheries, especially pelagic longline fisheries targeting tuna and/or swordfish, often land silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis), which are currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Due to increasing fishing effort and the fact that they overlap in habitat with target species, the population trend of silky sharks is declining worldwide. Understanding their relationships with environmental variables that lead to their capture by fisheries is critical for their management and conservation. Nevertheless, little is known about their size distribution in relation to environmental variables in the Pacific Ocean. Using data from the Chinese Observer Tuna Longline fishery from 2010 to 2020, this study developed a species distribution model (SDM) to analyze the relationships between silky shark size distribution patterns and environmental variables and spatio-temporal variability at fishing locations. Observed sizes ranged from 36 to 269 cm fork length (FL). The final model suggests that sea surface temperature (SST), primary production (photosynthetically available radiation, PAR), and ocean surface winds were the key environmental variables shaping size distribution patterns of silky sharks in the Pacific. A high proportion of larger silky sharks has been predicted in areas associated with productive upwelling systems. In addition, the model predicted that larger specimens (>140 cm FL) occur near the equator, and smaller specimens farther from the equator but still in tropical regions. Two regions in the eastern Pacific (the coastal upwelling area off northern Peru and the waters around the Galapagos Islands) seem to be important locations for larger specimens. The size distribution patterns of silky sharks in relation to environmental variables presented in this study illustrate how this species segregates spatially and temporally and presents potential habitat preference areas. The information obtained in the present study is critical in the quest for management and conservation of menaced species such as the silky shark.
10	35945934	Molecular identification and first demographic insights of sharks based on artisanal fisheries bycatch in the Pacific Coast of Colombia: implications for conservation.	The Pacific coast of Colombia is characterized by mangrove ecosystems which play a crucial role as possible nurseries for juvenile sharks. However, trophic food webs from coastal ecosystems are heavily disturbed by increased fishing pressure, which affects numerous shark species. In this region of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), fisheries' data from coastal areas are scarce and unspecific, as most sharks from artisanal fisheries are landed decapitated and finless, making their morphological identification difficult. For the establishment and implementation of effective regional conservation and management policies, information on the diversity and population dynamics of shark species is crucial. We therefore sequenced the mitochondrial NADH2 gene of 696 samples taken from fishermen's landings of shark's bycatch along the Colombian north Pacific coast. We were able to identify 14 species of sharks, two of the most abundant species were 
11	35939933	Organochlorine contaminants in Rio skate (Rioraja agassizii), an endangered batoid species, from southeastern coast of Brazil.	A global movement towards decreases in elasmobranch overfishing has been noted in the last decades. However, discussion concerning the effects of POP contamination on the health and survival of these organisms is still recent. These compounds can affect the immune and endocrine systems of both sharks and batoids, impairing reproduction and impacting species recruitment, acting synergistically alongside overfishing effects. In this context, this study investigated the concentration of organochlorine compounds in liver of 29 individuals of Rioraja agassizii, a commercially exploited skate classified as Vulnerable by IUCN and as Endangered in Brazil. Contaminant concentrations were higher in adults compared to juveniles. Distinct contamination profiles were observed, suggesting different groups within the investigated population and revealing contaminants as a potential tool to assess population ecology. PCB levels were considered a concern as they resemble concentrations in ecosystems from the northern hemisphere, where deleterious effects on elasmobranchs have been observed.
12	35901124	Nearshore marine biodiversity of Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica: Where the ocean meets the rainforest.	Osa Peninsula in remote southwest Costa Rica harbors 2.5% of global terrestrial biodiversity in only 1,200 km2 and has the largest remaining tract of Pacific lowland wet forest in Mesoamerica. However, little is known about the marine ecosystems of this diverse region. Much of the coastline consists of soft sediment exposed to strong wave action. Three major hard bottom habitat types define this region, including: 1) coral reefs around Isla del Caño Biological Reserve, a no-take marine protected area (MPA) of 52 km2, 2) coastal rocky reefs and islets along the peninsula, including Corcovado National Park, and 3) submerged pinnacles just outside the Isla del Caño MPA. Average coral cover at Isla del Caño was 21%, composed primarily of Porites lobata and Pocillopora elegans. In contrast, coastal rocky reefs were dominated by turf algae (39.8%) and macroalgae (20.7%) with low coral cover (1.1%). Submerged pinnacles were dominated by crustose coralline algae (33.3%) and erect coralline algae (25.7%). Fish assemblage characteristics (species richness, abundance, biomass) were significantly higher at the pinnacles compared to the other habitats and was dominated by schooling species such as Haemulon steindachneri, and the herbivores Kyphosus ocyurus, and Acanthurus xanthopterus. Top predators, primarily Triaenodon obesus, Caranx sexfasciatus, and Lutjanus argentimaculatus, were also most abundant at these pinnacles and accounted for the largest differences in fish trophic structure among habitats. Despite Isla del Caño being fully protected from fishing, biomass was similar to fished areas along the coast and lower than the adjacent submerged pinnacles outside the reserve. Similarly, Corcovado National Park includes 20.3 km2 of no-take MPAs; however, there is limited enforcement, and we noted several instances of fishing within the park. The unique configuration of healthy offshore coral reefs and pinnacles connected to coastal habitats provides corridors for many species including large predators such as sharks and other marine megafauna, which warrants additional protection.

14	35838789	Osmorespiratory compromise in an elasmobranch: oxygen consumption, ventilation and nitrogen metabolism during recovery from exhaustive exercise in dogfish sharks (Squalus suckleyi).	The functional trade-off between respiratory gas exchange versus osmolyte and water balance that occurs at the thin, highly vascularized gills of fishes has been termed the osmorespiratory compromise. Increases in gas exchange capacity for meeting elevated oxygen demands can end up favoring the passive movement of osmolytes and water, potentially causing a disturbance in osmotic balance. This phenomenon has been studied only sparsely in marine elasmobranchs. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of exhaustive exercise (as a modulator of oxygen demand) on oxygen consumption (MO

"The silky shark Carcharhinus falciformis is a large pelagic species distributed in the global oceans and was recently listed as ""Vulnerable"" by the IUCN because of its decline in population due to overfishing. As an apex predator, the silky shark can accumulate elevated quantities of mercury (Hg), posing a potential risk to its remaining population. In this study, total Hg (THg) concentrations were determined in silky shark muscle, liver, dermis, red blood cells (RBC) and plasma sampled from the eastern tropical Pacific, and δ"
16	35794151	The Australian Shark-Incident Database for quantifying temporal and spatial patterns of shark-human conflict.	We describe the Australian Shark-Incident Database, formerly known as the Australian Shark-Attack File, which contains comprehensive reports of 1,196 shark bites that have occurred in Australia over 231 years (1791-2022). Data were collated by the Taronga Conservation Society Australia using purpose-designed questionnaires provided to shark-bite victims or witnesses, media reports, and information provided by the department responsible for fisheries in each Australian state (including the Northern Territory). The dataset includes provoked and unprovoked bites from fresh, brackish, and marine waters in Australia. Data span 22 suspected shark species. This dataset will be publicly available, and can be used by analysts to decipher environmental, biological, and social patterns of shark bites in Australia. The information will aid scientists, conservationists, authorities, and members of the public to make informed decisions when implementing or selecting mitigation measures.
17	35765842	Decoding the dynamics of dental distributions: insights from shark demography and dispersal.	Shark teeth are one of the most abundant vertebrate fossils, and because tooth size generally correlates with body size, their accumulations document the size structure of populations. Understanding how ecological and environmental processes influence size structure, and how this extends to influence these dental distributions, may offer a window into the ecological and environmental dynamics of past and present shark populations. Here, we examine the dental distributions of sand tigers, including extant

"RATIONALE: The use of sulfur isotopes to study trophic ecology in marine ecosystems has increased in the past decade.

21	35687546	Using stable isotopes analysis to understand ontogenetic trophic variations of the scalloped hammerhead shark at the Galapagos Marine Reserve.	Changes in life-history requirements drive trophic variations, particularly in large marine predators. The life history of many shark species is still poorly known and understanding their dietary ontogeny is a challenging task, especially for highly migratory species. Stable isotope analysis has proven as a useful method for examining the foraging strategies of sharks and other marine predators. We assessed the foraging strategies and ontogenetic changes of scalloped hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna lewini, at Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), by analysing δ13C and δ15N signatures in different maturity stages. Our isotopic results suggest ontogenetic shifts in resource use between sub-adult and adult stages, but not between adult and juvenile stages. Carbon isotopic signatures found in the juvenile stage were enriched in contrast to sub-adults (~0.73‰) suggesting a combination of the maternal input and the use of coastal resources around the Galapagos Islands. Adult female sharks also showed enrichment in δ13C (~0.53‰) in comparison to sub-adult stages that suggest feeding in high primary productivity areas, such as the GMR. This study improves the understanding of the trophic ecology and ontogenetic changes of a highly migratory shark that moves across the protected and unprotected waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific.
22	35665538	Status of Southeast Asia's marine sharks and rays.	In Southeast Asia, elasmobranchs are particularly threatened. We synthesized knowledge from the peer-reviewed and gray literature on elasmobranchs in the region, including their fisheries, status, trade, biology, and management. We found that 59% of assessed species are threatened with extinction and 72.5% are in decline; rays were more threatened than sharks. Research and conservation is complicated by the socioeconomic contexts of the countries, geopolitical issues in the South China Sea, and the overcapacity and multispecies nature of fisheries that incidentally capture elasmobranchs. The general paucity of data, funds, personnel, and enforcement hinders management. Reduced capacity in the general fishery sector and marine protected areas of sufficient size (for elasmobranchs and local enforcement capabilities) are among recommendations to strengthen conservation.
23	35661942	Habitat-specific fish fauna responses to different management regimes in the largest coral reef complex in the South Atlantic.	"While marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasing worldwide, it is still needed to assess the effectiveness of those already consolidated. Methods and ecological assessments to understanding integrated and habitat-specific management regimes are still scarce and insufficient for policy implications and biodiversity conservation. Through Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV), we used fish assemblages as proxy of ecological and managerial status in two reef habitat types along three protection levels at Abrolhos Bank - the largest and most biodiverse coral reef complex of the South Atlantic. We found completely distinct responses in the fish fauna between the top (shallow) and bottom (deep) habitats of the unique ""chapeirões"" pinnacle reef formations. In the most protected zone (no-take), higher richness and abundance of commercial fish and more diverse trophic structure was observed. Particularly, large (sharks and groupers) and small carnivores (snappers) were more abundant and distributed more homogeneously over both reef habitats in the strictly enforced no-take zone. Abundance of these top-predators decreased from the low enforcement no-take zone to the multiple use area, where they were often absent while their typical preys (primary and secondary consumers) were thriving, notably in the top habitats. These outcomes highlight the importance to focus investigations not selectively on a single habitat type or depth zone in order to properly assess MPA effectiveness. Consequently, the monitoring and protection of fish species supported by marine spatial planning may benefit from an improved understanding of ecological functioning provided by MPA performance."
24	35661219	Serum protein electrophoresis reference intervals for six species of wild-sampled sharks in South Florida.	Serum proteins found in the blood have been used as diagnostic markers in both human and animal medicine. Evaluating proteins in the blood of sharks may be a valuable way to assess shark health. The purpose of this study was to perform serum protein electrophoresis from non-lethal blood samples of wild sharks and establish baseline values for six species off South Florida: blacknose (Carcharhinus acronotus), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), bull (Carcharhinus leucas), lemon (Negaprion brevirostris), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus), and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Two hundred and fifty-one serum samples were collected between 2015-2018 along with sex determination and morphometric measurements. Agarose gel analysis was performed using mammalian protein fraction delimits albumin, alpha 1-globulins, alpha 2-globulins, beta globulins, and gamma globulins alternatively defined as fractions 1-5. Reference electrophoretic profiles were established for each species, revealing the dominance of protein fractions 3 and 4. The fraction 3:4 ratio was determined for each shark and reference intervals for total solids, protein fractions, and fraction 3:4 ratio are reported for each species. There were no significant differences in total solids or protein fractions between males and females of any species. In both blacktip sharks and bull sharks, total solids was positively correlated with body size, but not in the other species evaluated. In blacknose sharks, the fraction 3:4 ratio was positively correlated with body condition. Results suggest that there may be differences in total solids values across dry and wet seasons for some species. Newly established reference intervals can now be utilized in future research to evaluate the health of captive sharks and to investigate the health status of individuals in the wild as well as relate health measures to environmental conditions.

26	35638311	Citizen science reveals the population structure and seasonal presence of whale sharks in the Gulf of Thailand.	The whale shark Rhincodon typus is a broadly distributed and highly mobile planktivorous shark species. The sharks form predictable aggregations in many areas, providing the opportunity for cost-effective scientific monitoring through divers and other marine resource users. Sightings of individuals outside of these aggregate zones elsewhere in their range are typically rare. We used a citizen science-based approach to shed light on occurrence and seasonality in the waters around Koh Tao, Thailand and neighbouring islands in the Gulf of Thailand. Although there is a paucity of quantitative data, anecdotal reports suggest substantial declines in sightings in the early 2000s. We identified a total of 178 individual whale sharks (from 249 sightings) between 2004 and 2019, with most of these (84%) from the 2015-2019 time period due to an increase in sighting reports facilitated by social media and direct marketing. Size estimates were reported for 102 of the sightings, with a range of 2-6 m and mean of 3.7 m overall. Sex was reported for 27% of sightings, with a 2:1 female-to-male ratio. Modified maximum likelihood methods suggest whale sharks are transient to Koh Tao and surrounding areas, with whale shark sightings following the regional monsoon cycle. One international resighting was obtained from Malaysian waters (~700 km away). Encouraging citizen science participation is particularly useful in data-poor regions like the Gulf of Thailand, despite limitations in size and sex estimation reliability, which can play an important complementary role in dedicated research programs.
27	35607969	Observations of a species-record deep dive by a central Pacific female scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini).	A female scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) conducted a species record deep dive to 1240 m in coastal-pelagic waters off Hawaii Island. This extends the deepest known depth range of the species by over 200 m (650 ft) and highlights the question of the extent to which deep-diving activity is mediated by physiological constraints, such as temperature and oxygen availability.
28	35606841	Microbiome differences between wild and aquarium whitespotted eagle rays (Aetobatus narinari).	"BACKGROUND: Animal-associated microbiomes can be influenced by both host and environmental factors. Comparing wild animals to those in zoos or aquariums can help disentangle the effects of host versus environmental factors, while also testing whether managed conditions foster a 'natural' host microbiome. Focusing on an endangered elasmobranch species-the whitespotted eagle ray Aetobatus narinari-we compared the skin, gill, and cloaca microbiomes of wild individuals to those at Georgia Aquarium. Whitespotted eagle ray microbiomes from Georgia Aquarium were also compared to those of cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) in the same exhibit, allowing us to explore the effect of host identity on the ray microbiome.
RESULTS: Long-term veterinary monitoring indicated that the rays in managed care did not have a history of disease and maintained health parameters consistent with those of wild individuals, with one exception. Aquarium whitespotted eagle rays were regularly treated to control parasite loads, but the effects on animal health were subclinical. Microbiome α- and β-diversity differed between wild versus aquarium whitespotted eagle rays at all body sites, with α-diversity significantly higher in wild individuals. β-diversity differences in wild versus aquarium whitespotted eagle rays were greater for skin and gill microbiomes compared to those of the cloaca. At each body site, we also detected microbial taxa shared between wild and aquarium eagle rays. Additionally, the cloaca, skin, and gill microbiomes of aquarium eagle rays differed from those of cownose rays in the same exhibit. Potentially pathogenic bacteria were at low abundance in all wild and aquarium rays.
CONCLUSION: For whitespotted eagle rays, managed care was associated with a microbiome differing significantly from that of wild individuals. These differences were not absolute, as the microbiome of aquarium rays shared members with that of wild counterparts and was distinct from that of a cohabitating ray species. Eagle rays under managed care appear healthy, suggesting that their microbiomes are not associated with compromised host health. However, the ray microbiome is dynamic, differing with both environmental factors and host identity. Monitoring of aquarium ray microbiomes over time may identify taxonomic patterns that co-vary with host health."
29	35591772	Delineation of blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) nursery habitats in the north-western Gulf of Mexico.	Coevolution with predators leads to the use of low-risk habitats by many prey species, which promotes survival during early developmental phases. These nurseries are valued by conservation and management agencies because of their contributions to adult populations. However, the physical and geographic characteristics, like shallow depths and isolation from other marine habitats, that restrict access to predators and thereby reduce risk to juvenile animals can also limit scientific research. Consequently, many nursery habitats are still unidentified and understudied. Here we used gillnet monitoring from 1982 to 2018 to delineate blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) nurseries in the north-western Gulf of Mexico and elucidated their physical, environmental and biological characteristics. Nursery habitats within estuaries (<2% of spatial area) were proximate to the Gulf of Mexico and exhibited significantly lower variability in salinity than non-nurseries. However, relative abundances of predators and prey were not significant delineators of nursery habitats. As such, food and risk may not influence juvenile blacktip habitat use as expected. Alternatively, reduced osmoregulatory stress attributed to predictable environments likely provides advantageous conditions for blacktips to develop foraging and antipredator tactics, which is vital prior to the winter migration of juvenile sharks into the Gulf of Mexico.
30	35536602	An epithelial signalling centre in sharks supports homology of tooth morphogenesis in vertebrates.	Development of tooth shape is regulated by the enamel knot signalling centre, at least in mammals. Fgf signalling regulates differential proliferation between the enamel knot and adjacent dental epithelia during tooth development, leading to formation of the dental cusp. The presence of an enamel knot in non-mammalian vertebrates is debated given differences in signalling. Here, we show the conservation and restriction of 
31	35533277	Global collision-risk hotspots of marine traffic and the world's largest fish, the whale shark.	Marine traffic is increasing globally yet collisions with endangered megafauna such as whales, sea turtles, and planktivorous sharks go largely undetected or unreported. Collisions leading to mortality can have population-level consequences for endangered species. Hence, identifying simultaneous space use of megafauna and shipping throughout ranges may reveal as-yet-unknown spatial targets requiring conservation. However, global studies tracking megafauna and shipping occurrences are lacking. Here we combine satellite-tracked movements of the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, and vessel activity to show that 92% of sharks’ horizontal space use and nearly 50% of vertical space use overlap with persistent large vessel (>300 gross tons) traffic. Collision-risk estimates correlated with reported whale shark mortality from ship strikes, indicating higher mortality in areas with greatest overlap. Hotspots of potential collision risk were evident in all major oceans, predominantly from overlap with cargo and tanker vessels, and were concentrated in gulf regions, where dense traffic co-occurred with seasonal shark movements. Nearly a third of whale shark hotspots overlapped with the highest collision-risk areas, with the last known locations of tracked sharks coinciding with busier shipping routes more often than expected. Depth-recording tags provided evidence for sinking, likely dead, whale sharks, suggesting substantial “cryptic” lethal ship strikes are possible, which could explain why whale shark population declines continue despite international protection and low fishing-induced mortality. Mitigation measures to reduce ship-strike risk should be considered to conserve this species and other ocean giants that are likely experiencing similar impacts from growing global vessel traffic.
32	35475478	Market surveys and social media provide confirmation of the endangered giant freshwater whipray Urogymnus polylepis in Myanmar.	The giant freshwater whipray Urogymnus polylepis is a threatened species that is vulnerable to riverine and coastal marine pressures. Despite its threatened status, the range of U. polylepis is still being determined. In this study, photographic evidence of U. polylepis in Myanmar was provided through market surveys (2017-2018) and social media (Sharks and Rays of Rakhine Facebook page, 2021). Urogymnus polylepis is exposed to fisheries and habitat degradation pressures in Myanmar; therefore, conservation management is likely needed to ensure populations persist into the future.
33	35449381	The distribution of manta rays in the western North Atlantic Ocean off the eastern United States.	In 2018, the giant manta ray was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We integrated decades of sightings and survey effort data from multiple sources in a comprehensive species distribution modeling (SDM) framework to evaluate the distribution of giant manta rays off the eastern United States, including the Gulf of Mexico. Manta rays were most commonly detected at productive nearshore and shelf-edge upwelling zones at surface thermal frontal boundaries within a temperature range of approximately 20-30 °C. SDMs predicted highest nearshore occurrence off northeastern Florida during April, with the distribution extending northward along the shelf-edge as temperatures warm, leading to higher occurrences north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina from June to October, and then south of Savannah, Georgia from November to March as temperatures cool. In the Gulf of Mexico, the highest nearshore occurrence was predicted around the Mississippi River delta from April to June and again from October to November. SDM predictions will allow resource managers to more effectively protect manta rays from fisheries bycatch, boat strikes, oil and gas activities, contaminants and pollutants, and other threats.
34	35446438	Thirty-five years of tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier relative abundance near Bimini, The Bahamas, and the Southeastern United States with a comparison across jurisdictional bounds.	Abundances of large sharks are reported to have declined worldwide, and in response various levels of fisheries management and conservation efforts have been established. For example, marine-protected areas have been suggested as a means to protect large expanses of ocean from fishing and other industrial activities (e.g., habitat destruction), and in 2011 The Commonwealth of The Bahamas established The Bahamas Shark Sanctuary. Nonetheless, assessing the effectiveness of conservation efforts is challenging because consistent long-term data sets of shark abundances are often lacking, especially throughout the Caribbean and The Bahamas. In this study, the authors investigated the catch rates and demographics of tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier caught in a fishery-independent survey near Bimini, The Bahamas, from 1984 to 2019 to assess relative abundance trends following the banning of longline fishing in 1993 and the subsequent establishment of the shark sanctuary. To contextualize the relative abundance trends near Bimini, the authors compared this to the relative abundance of tiger sharks in a fishery-dependent survey from the Southeastern USA (SE USA), conducted from 1994 to 2019. The data of this study suggest that local abundance of tiger sharks has been stable near Bimini since the 1980s, including after the ban of longline fishing and the implementation of the shark sanctuary. In comparison, the abundance near the SE USA has slowly increased in the past decade, following potential declines in the decade preceding the USA Shark Management Plan. The results of this study provide some optimism that current conservation efforts in The Bahamas have been effective to maintain local tiger shark abundance within the protected area. In addition, current fisheries management in the SE USA is allowing this species to recover within those waters.
35	35444192	Acoustic discrimination in the grey bamboo shark Chiloscyllium griseum.	Cognitive abilities of sharks are well developed and comparable to teleosts and other vertebrates. Most studies exploring elasmobranch cognitive abilities have used visual stimuli, assessing a wide range of discrimination tasks, memory retention and spatial learning abilities. Some studies using acoustic stimuli in a cognitive context have been conducted, but a basic understanding of sound induced behavioural changes and the underlying mechanisms involved are still lacking. This study explored the acoustic discrimination abilities of seven juvenile grey bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium griseum) using a Go/No-Go method, which so far had never been tested in sharks before. After this, the smallest frequency difference leading to a change in behaviour in the sharks was studied using a series of transfer tests. Our results show that grey bamboo sharks can learn a Go/No-Go task using both visual and acoustic stimuli. Transfer tests elucidated that, when both stimulus types were presented, both were used. Within the tested range of 90-210 Hz, a frequency difference of 20-30 Hz is sufficient to discriminate the two sounds, which is comparable to results previously collected for sharks and teleosts. Currently, there is still a substantial lack of knowledge concerning the acoustic abilities and sound induced behaviours of sharks while anthropogenic noise is constantly on the rise. New insights into shark sound recognition, detection and use are therefore of the utmost importance and will aid in management and conservation efforts of sharks.
36	35437805	Baseline Health and Nutritional Parameters of Wild Sand Tigers Sampled in Delaware Bay.	Species-specific hematological reference values are essential for diagnosis and treatment of disease and maintaining overall health of animals. This information is lacking for many species of elasmobranchs maintained in zoos and aquaria, thus reducing the effectiveness of care for these animals. Descriptive statistics and reference intervals were calculated for hematocrit and complete blood cell counts, biochemistry and protein electrophoresis parameters, trace minerals, vitamins, heavy metals, reproductive hormones, and fatty acids in the blood of 153 wild Sand Tigers Carcharias taurus of both sexes and a range of sizes caught in Delaware Bay (Delaware, USA). Mean hematocrit, total white blood cell counts, lymphocyte differentials, glucose, phosphorus, amylase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were significantly higher in juveniles than in adults. Levels of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and differences in selenium and eicosapentaenoic acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid) between males and females suggest that they are important parameters for improving Sand Tiger breeding success in managed care. Finally, blood metal levels for arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury suggest low levels of contaminant exposure for Sand Tigers during their summer residence in Delaware Bay. The results of this study provide baseline health parameters for wild Sand Tigers that will aid in effective maintenance of aquarium animals and contribute to a greater understanding of the biology of these sharks and efforts to accomplish sustainable management of their populations.
37	35435294	Conceptual frameworks and key questions for assessing the contribution of marine protected areas to shark and ray conservation.	"Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are key tools in addressing the global decline of sharks and rays, with ""marine parks"" and ""shark sanctuaries"" of various configurations established to conserve shark populations. There is also a rapidly growing body of telemetry research used to assess MPA performance in shark protection. However, assessments of MPA efficacy in shark and ray conservation are compromised by inconsistent terminology, a lack of standardised approaches to assess how MPAs contribute to the overall conservation of sharks and rays, and ambiguity about integrating movement data into assessment processes. This paper presents a conceptual framework that standardises key terms and uses the concept of Portfolio Risk to fully describe how an MPA may contribute to shark and ray conservation. The framework also demonstrates how movement data can be integrated into the process and presents eight key questions that provide guidance for applying the framework. Understanding an MPA's contribution to shark and ray protection requires explicit consideration of the assessment scope, MPA type and purpose, the range of existing and potential threats, the species biology and ecology, and management and operational contexts. Ultimately, MPA contributions to shark and ray conservation differ according to a complex set of human and natural factors and interactions which should be carefully considered in MPA design, implementation and evaluation.

38	35405792	What Is in Your Shark Fin Soup? Probably an Endangered Shark Species and a Bit of Mercury.	Shark fin soup, consumed by Asian communities throughout the world, is one of the principal drivers of the demand of shark fins. This near USD 1 billion global industry has contributed to a shark population declines of up to 70%. In an effort to arrest these declines, the trade in several species of sharks is regulated under the auspices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Despite this legal framework, the dried fins of trade-regulated sharks are frequently sold in markets and consumed in shark fin soup. Shark fins found in soups break down into a fibrous mass of ceratotrichia, meaning that identifying the species of sharks in the soup becomes impossible by visual methods. In this paper, we use DNA barcoding to identify the species of sharks found in bowls of shark fin soup collected in Singapore. The most common species identified in our samples was the blue shark (
39	35365676	A biologging database of juvenile white sharks from the northeast Pacific.	Species occurrence records are vital data streams in marine conservation with a wide range of important applications. From 2001-2020, the Monterey Bay Aquarium led an international research collaboration to understand the life cycle, ecology, and behavior of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) in the southern California Current. The collaboration was devoted to tagging juveniles with animal-borne sensors, also known as biologging. Here we report the full data records from 59 pop-up archival (PAT) and 20 smart position and temperature transmitting (SPOT) tags that variously recorded pressure, temperature, and light-level data, and computed depth and geolocations for 63 individuals. Whether transmitted or from recovered devices, raw data files from successful deployments (n = 70) were auto-ingested from the manufacturer into the United States (US) Animal Telemetry Network's (ATN) Data Assembly Center (DAC). There they have attributed a full suite of metadata, visualized within their public-facing data portal, compiled for permanent archive under the DataONE Research Workspace member node, and are accessible for download from the ATN data portal.
40	35333436	Predator-prey landscapes of large sharks and game fishes in the Florida Keys.	Interspecific interactions can play an essential role in shaping wildlife populations and communities. To date, assessments of interspecific interactions, and more specifically predator-prey dynamics, in aquatic systems over broad spatial and temporal scales (i.e., hundreds of kilometers and multiple years) are rare due to constraints on our abilities to measure effectively at those scales. We applied new methods to identify space-use overlap and potential predation risk to Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and permit (Trachinotus falcatus) from two known predators, great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and bull (Carcharhinus leucas) sharks, over a 3-year period using acoustic telemetry in the coastal region of the Florida Keys (USA). By examining spatiotemporal overlap, as well as the timing and order of arrival at specific locations compared to random chance, we show that potential predation risk from great hammerhead and bull sharks to Atlantic tarpon and permit are heterogeneous across the Florida Keys. Additionally, we find that predator encounter rates with these game fishes are elevated at specific locations and times, including a prespawning aggregation site in the case of Atlantic tarpon. Further, using machine learning algorithms, we identify environmental variability in overlap between predators and their potential prey, including location, habitat, time of year, lunar cycle, depth, and water temperature. These predator-prey landscapes provide insights into fundamental ecosystem function and biological conservation, especially in the context of emerging fishery-related depredation issues in coastal marine ecosystems.
41	35324946	Depth and benthic habitat influence shallow and mesophotic predatory fishes on a remote, high-latitude coral reef.	Predatory fishes on coral reefs continue to decline globally despite playing key roles in ecosystem functioning. Remote atolls and platform reefs provide potential refugia for predator populations, but quantitative information on their spatial distribution is required to establish accurate baselines for ongoing monitoring and conservation management. Current knowledge of predatory fish populations has been derived from targeted shallow diver-based surveys (<15 m). However, the spatial distribution and extent of predatory fishes on outer mesophotic shelf environments has remained under described. Middleton Reef is a remote, high-latitude, oceanic platform reef that is located within a no-take area in the Lord Howe Marine Park off eastern Australia. Here we used baited remote underwater stereo video to sample predatory fishes across lagoon and outer shelf habitats from depths 0-100 m, extending knowledge on use of mesophotic depths and habitats. Many predatory fish demonstrated clear depth and habitat associations over this depth range. Carcharhinid sharks and Carangid fishes were the most abundant predators sampled on Middleton Reef, with five predatory fishes accounting for over 90% of the predator fish biomass. Notably, Galapagos shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and the protected black rockcod (Epinephelus daemelii) dominated the predator fish assemblage. A higher richness of predator fish species was sampled on reef areas north and south of the lagoon. The more exposed southern aspect of the reef supported a different suite of predator fish across mesophotic habitats relative to the assemblage recorded in the north and lagoonal habitats, a pattern potentially driven by differences in hard coral cover. Biomass of predatory fishes in the more sheltered north habitats was twice that of other areas, predominantly driven by high abundances of Galapagos shark. This work adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the conservation value of isolated oceanic reefs and the need to ensure that lagoon, shallow and mesophotic habitats in these systems are adequately protected, as they support vulnerable ecologically and economically important predator fish assemblages.
42	35317626	Social dynamics and individual hunting tactics of white sharks revealed by biologging.	Social foraging, where animals forage in groups, takes many forms but is less studied in marine predators as measuring social associations in the wild is challenging. We used biologging (activity, cameras and telemetry receivers) sensors to measure social associations and simultaneous behaviour, in white sharks (

Analyses of genetic diversity can shed light on both the origins of biodiversity hotspots, as well as the conservation status of species that are impacted by human activities. With these objectives, we assembled a genomic dataset of 14,935 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 513 grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) sampled across 17 locations in the tropical Indo-Pacific. We analysed geographic variation in genetic diversity, estimated ancient and contemporary effective population size (N

(Elasmobranchii: Scyliorhinidae Gill, 1862) off Tunisia, with a key to species of the genus Echinocephalus.	Echinocephalus caniculus n. sp. (Nematoda, Gnathostomatidae Railliet, 1895) was isolated from the spiral valve of the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula (L.) from the waters off Kalaat El Andalous, North East Tunisia. This new species is mainly characterized by a cephalic bulb armed with 31-39 transverse rows of uncinated hooks, a comparatively long oesophagus, short spicules and the presence of a gubernaculum. The new species differs from its congeners by having four cervical sacs of almost equal length, a higher oesophagus/body length ratio, the arrangement of the caudal papillae, the absence of a medioventral preanal organ and numerous scattered `pores´ limited to the lateral side of the posterior part of the body. This is the first report of a member of the genus Echinocephalus Molin, 1858 from the Tunisian coast, and a new host and locality record for the Gnathostomatidae. A key to the species of Echinocephalus is provided.
45	35259943	Energy conservation characterizes sleep in sharks.	Sharks represent the earliest group of jawed vertebrates and as such, they may provide original insight for understanding the evolution of sleep in more derived animals. Unfortunately, beyond a single behavioural investigation, very little is known about sleep in these ancient predators. As such, recordings of physiological indicators of sleep in sharks have never been reported. Reduced energy expenditure arising from sustained restfulness and lowered metabolic rate during sleep have given rise to the hypothesis that sleep plays an important role for energy conservation. To determine whether this idea applies also to sharks, we compared metabolic rates of draughtsboard sharks (
46	35169123	Global patterns in functional rarity of marine fish.	Rare species, which represent a large fraction of the taxa in ecological assemblages, account for much of the biological diversity on Earth. These species make substantial contributions to ecosystem functioning, and are targets of conservation policy. Here we adopt an integrated approach, combining information on the rarity of species trait combinations, and their spatial restrictedness, to quantify the biogeography of rare fish (a taxon with almost 13,000 species) in the world's oceans. We find concentrations of rarity, in excess of what is predicted by a null expectation, near the coasts and at higher latitudes. We also observe mismatches between these rarity hotspots and marine protected areas. This pattern is repeated for both major groupings of fish, the Actinopterygii (bony fish) and Elasmobranchii (sharks, skates and rays). These results uncover global patterns of rarity that were not apparent from earlier work, and highlight the importance of using metrics that incorporate information on functional traits in the conservation and management of global marine fishes.
47	35132104	Extensive oceanic mesopelagic habitat use of a migratory continental shark species.	The identification of movement and behaviour patterns, as well as inter- and intra-population connectivity is crucial in order to implement effective and functional management and conservation measures for threatened migratory species such as tope (Galeorhinus galeus). Yet, previous studies struggled to elucidate clear and consistent movement and depth usage patterns of adult tope in the Northeast Atlantic, suggesting a high plasticity in the migration and behaviour. We deployed pop-up satellite archival tags on adult tope during their seasonal summer aggregations in the inner German Bight of the south-eastern North Sea and near a presumed mating site in southwest Scotland. Depth distribution and migration pathways were derived from time series data with location processing. Four individuals followed migration trajectories leaving coastal areas and crossed the European shelf slope into oceanic areas of the Northeast Atlantic, remaining fully pelagic for the rest of the deployment duration. These sharks showed far-ranging migration trajectories and undertook regular and frequent diel vertical migrations, reaching daytime depths of over 700 m. Vertical migration patterns closely overlapped with biological mesopelagic habitat structures and closely tracked the diel migration of organisms from deep scattering layers derived from hydroacoustic recordings. It is hypothesized that adult tope regularly utilize oceanic habitats, foraging on mesopelagic layers in an environment generally considered of low prey density.

There is a common phenomenon in nature whereby some animals have differences in their ontogenetic changes in dietary preferences between sexes, especially apex predators. These reflect changes in the needs of development during their lifetimes. Apex predators potentially have diverse dietary niches and a large impact on the trophic dynamics within ecosystems. However, the difference in life history between males and females often leads to increased difficulty in management and conservation. In this study, 25 oceanic whitetip sharks, 
50	35125620	Marine resource recovery in Southern Thailand during COVID-19 and policy recommendations.	COVID-19 and subsequent government health containment measures have slowed down economic activities worldwide, particularly tourism. With the number of foreign tourists entering Thailand during 2020 and 2021 greatly diminished, the number of tourists at marine and coastal attractions in Southern Thailand has declined as well. This study found evidence of a relationship between the decline of the number of tourists and marine resource recovery. This recovery appears in the form of cleaner beaches, clearer seawater and increased sighting of marine animals. Between 2020 and 2021, official reports found increased sighting of dugongs, dolphins, blacktip reef sharks, whale sharks, leopard sharks, sea turtles, green turtles, hawksbill turtles, and false killer whales at marine national parks in Southern Thailand. The study also found that, prior to the COVD-19 outbreak, the number of tourists at Patong Beach and Maya Bay exceeded their tourism carrying capacities. Finally, this study proposes eight policy measures related to tourism management for marine resource sustainability: conservation and recreation zoning, enforcing marine park closure, redesigning marine park entrance fee systems, ensuring adequate recreational facilities, stricter enforcement of the law, promoting alternative tourism sites, encouraging more inclusivity and participation in decision making processes, and enhancing public awareness.
51	35051468	A comprehensive petrochemical vulnerability index for marine fishes in the Gulf of Mexico.	Oil and gas extraction activities occur across the globe, yet species-specific toxicological information on the biological and ecological impacts of exposure to petrochemicals is lacking for the vast majority of marine species. To help prioritize species for recovery, mitigation, and conservation in light of significant toxicological data gaps, a trait-based petrochemical vulnerability index was developed and applied to the more than 1700 marine fishes present across the entire Gulf of Mexico, including all known bony fishes, sharks, rays and chimaeras. Using life history and other traits related to likelihood of exposure, physiological sensitivity to exposure, and population resiliency, final calculated petrochemical vulnerability scores can be used to provide information on the relative sensitivity, or resilience, of marine fish populations across the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas activities. Based on current knowledge of traits, marine fishes with the highest vulnerability scores primarily occur in areas of high petrochemical activity, are found at or near the surface, and have low reproductive turnover rates and/or highly specialized diet and habitat requirements. Relative population vulnerability scores for marine fishes can be improved with additional toxicokinetic studies, including those that account for the synergistic or additive effect of multiple stressors, as well as increased research on ecological and life history traits, especially for deep living species.
52	35031666	Drivers of variation in occurrence, abundance, and behaviour of sharks on coral reefs.	Quantifying the drivers of population size in reef sharks is critical for the development of appropriate conservation strategies. In north-west Australia, shark populations inhabit coral reefs that border growing centres of human population, industry, and tourism. However, we lack baseline data on reef sharks at large spatial scales (hundreds of km) that might enable managers to assess the status of shark populations in the face of future development in this region. Here, we examined the occurrence, abundance and behaviour of apex (Galeocerdo cuvier, Carcharhinus plumbeus) and reef (C. amblyrhynchos, C. melanopterus, Triaenodon obesus) sharks using > 1200 deployments of baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) across > 500 km of coastline. We found evidence for species-specific influences of habitat and fishing activities on the occurrence (probability of observation), abundance (MaxN) and behaviour of sharks (time of arrival to the stereo-BRUVs and likelihood of feeding). Although the presence of management zoning (No-take areas) made little difference to most species, C. amblyrhynchos were more common further from boat ramps (a proxy of recreational fishing pressure). Time of arrival for all species was also influenced by distance to boat ramp, although patterns varied among species. Our results demonstrate the capacity for behavioural metrics to complement existing measures of occurrence and abundance in assessing the potential impact of human activities on shark populations.

54	35023247	Ocean warming alters the distributional range, migratory timing, and spatial protections of an apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier).	Given climate change threats to ecosystems, it is critical to understand the responses of species to warming. This is especially important in the case of apex predators since they exhibit relatively high extinction risk, and changes to their distribution could impact predator-prey interactions that can initiate trophic cascades. Here we used a combined analysis of animal tracking, remotely sensed environmental data, habitat modeling, and capture data to evaluate the effects of climate variability and change on the distributional range and migratory phenology of an ectothermic apex predator, the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Tiger sharks satellite tracked in the western North Atlantic between 2010 and 2019 revealed significant annual variability in the geographic extent and timing of their migrations to northern latitudes from ocean warming. Specifically, tiger shark migrations have extended farther poleward and arrival times to northern latitudes have occurred earlier in the year during periods with anomalously high sea-surface temperatures. A complementary analysis of nearly 40 years of tiger shark captures in the region revealed decadal-scale changes in the distribution and timing of shark captures in parallel with long-term ocean warming. Specifically, areas of highest catch densities have progressively increased poleward and catches have occurred earlier in the year off the North American shelf. During periods of anomalously high sea-surface temperatures, movements of tracked sharks shifted beyond spatial management zones that had been affording them protection from commercial fishing and bycatch. Taken together, these study results have implications for fisheries management, human-wildlife conflict, and ecosystem functioning.
55	34986563	Foraging plasticity diversifies mercury exposure sources and bioaccumulation patterns in the world's largest predatory fish.	Large marine predators exhibit high concentrations of mercury (Hg) as neurotoxic methylmercury, and the potential impacts of global change on Hg contamination in these species remain highly debated. Current contaminant model predictions do not account for intraspecific variability in Hg exposure and may fail to reflect the diversity of future Hg levels among conspecific populations or individuals, especially for top predators displaying a wide range of ecological traits. Here, we used Hg isotopic compositions to show that Hg exposure sources varied significantly between and within three populations of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) with contrasting ecology: the north-eastern Pacific, eastern Australasian, and south-western Australasian populations.

Trace elements can be accumulated by marine predators and may have detrimental effects on population dynamics.

In addition, the habitat range of whale sharks intersects with several recognized microplastic pollution hotspots, among which is the Coral Triangle. Direct evidence for microplastic ingestion in whale sharks however, has not yet been presented.

58	34932875	Insights into genetic variation and demographic history of sharpnose rays: examinations of three species of Telatrygon (Elasmobranchii, Dasyatidae) from the Indo-West Pacific.	Coastal and demersal chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, and skates) are expected to exhibit high levels of genetic differentiation in areas of complex geomorphology. Population genetic studies investigating the extent to which demographic history shapes the genetic structure of these fishes are rare. Here, we combined mitochondrial DNA (Cytb and ND2) and 8 nuclear microsatellite loci from 244 individuals to examine the population genetic structure and demographic history of the 3 Indo-West Pacific species of sharpnose rays (Telatrygon zugei, Telatrygon biasa, and Trygon crozieri). High levels of genetic variation both within and between species were identified. Phylogenetic analysis partitioned haplotypes into 2 lineages supporting divergence of T. zugei from T. crozieri and T. biasa during the Pleistocene. Furthermore, microsatellite-based clustering analyses identified 4 genetic groups (i.e. T. zugei from Japan, T. zugei from coastal China, T. biasa from Gulf of Thailand, and T. crozieri from the Andaman Sea). Measurements of genetic differentiation also support these 4 groups. Additionally, Pleistocene demographic expansions were examined in all genetic groups. The climate oscillations and current hydrologic cycles in the Indo-West Pacific appear to coincide with the hypothesis regarding speciation and the observed demographic history trends of the sharpnose rays. Considering the species group has, until recently, been thought to be one species, these results are critical for defining management units and guiding conservation efforts to preserve stingray biodiversity.
59	34914101	Growth estimates of young-of-the-year broadnose sevengill shark, Notorynchus cepedianus, a top predator with poorly calcified vertebrae.	The broadnose sevengill shark, Notorynchus cepedianus (Péron, 1807), is a large marine top predator in temperate coastal ecosystems. Some aspects of its life history have been determined, but its growth pattern is yet to be fully understood. The authors used a multi-modelling approach and a sensitivity test to estimate growth parameters from young-of-year (YOY) length data collected off San Antonio Cape (SAC), Argentina, a critical habitat in the Southwest Atlantic Coastal Zone (SACZ). The best selected model, a sex-combined logistic growth model, estimated an asymptotic length (L
60	34827127	Environmental DNA (eDNA) Metabarcoding in the Fish Market and Nearby Seafood Restaurants in Taiwan Reveals the Underestimation of Fish Species Diversity in Seafood.	Seafood, especially the traditional one in Taiwan, is rarely sourced from a fixed species and routinely from similar species depending on their availability. Hence, the species composition of seafood can be complicated. While a DNA-based approach has been routinely utilized for species identification, a large scale of seafood identification in fish markets and restaurants could be challenging (e.g., elevated cost and time-consuming only for a limited number of species identification). In the present study, we aimed to identify the majority of fish species potentially consumed in fish markets and nearby seafood restaurants using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Four eDNA samplings from a local fish market and nearby seafood restaurants were conducted using Sterivex cartridges. Nineteen universal primers previously validated for fish species identification were utilized to amplify the fragments of mitochondrial DNA (12S, COI, ND5) of species in eDNA samples and sequenced with NovaSeq 6000 sequencing. A total of 153 fish species have been identified based on 417 fish related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated from 50,534,995 reads. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) further showed the differences in fish species between the sampling times and sampling sites. Of these fish species, 22 chondrichthyan fish, 14 Anguilliformes species, and 15 Serranidae species were respectively associated with smoked sharks, braised moray eels, and grouper fish soups. To our best knowledge, this work represents the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of a large scale of seafood identification using eDNA metabarcoding approach. Our findings also imply the species diversity in traditional seafood might be seriously underestimated and crucial for the conservation and management of marine resources.

Effective conservation and management necessitate an understanding of the ecological mechanisms that shape species life histories in order to predict how variability in natural and anthropogenic impacts will alter growth rates, recruitment, and survival. Among these mechanisms, the interaction between parturition timing and prey availability frequently influences offspring success, particularly when postnatal care is absent. Here, we assess how parturition timing and nursery conditions, including prey abundance and environmental conditions, influence the growth and potential survival of blacktip sharks (
62	34824811	Defining distribution and habitat use of west-central Florida's coastal sharks through a research and education program.	"Identifying critical habitat for highly mobile species such as sharks is difficult, but essential for effective management and conservation. In regions where baseline data are lacking, non-traditional data sources have the potential to increase observational capacity for species distribution and habitat studies. In this study, a research and education organization conducted a 5-year (2013-2018) survey of shark populations in the coastal waters of west-central Florida, an area where a diverse shark assemblage has been observed but no formal population analyses have been conducted. The objectives of this study were to use boosted regression tree (BRT) modeling to quantify environmental factors impacting the distribution of the shark assemblage, create species distribution maps from the model outputs, and identify spatially explicit hot spots of high shark abundance. A total of 1036 sharks were captured, encompassing eleven species. Abundance hot spots for four species and for immature sharks (collectively) were most often located in areas designated as ""No Internal Combustion Engine"" zones and seagrass bottom cover, suggesting these environments may be fostering more diverse and abundant populations. The BRT models were fitted for immature sharks and five species where "

Globally, marine animal distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate. These shifts are usually considered at the species level, but individuals are likely to differ in how they respond to the changing conditions. Here, we investigate how movement behaviour and, therefore, redistribution, would differ by sex and maturation class in a wide-ranging marine predator. We tracked 115 tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) from 2002 to 2020 and forecast class-specific distributions through to 2030, including environmental factors and predicted occurrence of potential prey. Generalised Linear and Additive Models revealed that water temperature change, particularly at higher latitudes, was the factor most associated with shark movements. Females dispersed southwards during periods of warming temperatures, and while juvenile females preferred a narrow thermal range between 22 and 23 °C, adult female and juvenile male presence was correlated with either lower (< 22 °C) or higher (> 23 °C) temperatures. During La Niña, sharks moved towards higher latitudes and used shallower isobaths. Inclusion of predicted distribution of their putative prey significantly improved projections of suitable habitats for all shark classes, compared to simpler models using temperature alone. Tiger shark range off the east coast of Australia is predicted to extend ~ 3.5° south towards the east coast of Tasmania, particularly for juvenile males. Our framework highlights the importance of combining long-term movement data with multi-factor habitat projections to identify heterogeneity within species when predicting consequences of climate change. Recognising intraspecific variability will improve conservation and management strategies and help anticipate broader ecosystem consequences of species redistribution due to ocean warming.
64	34749115	Mercury concentrations and trophic relations in sharks of the Pacific Ocean of Colombia.	Sharks are fished for human consumption in Colombia, and fins are exported illegally to international markets. The goal was to identify differences in total mercury (THg) concentrations in fins and muscles of shark species seized in the Buenaventura port (Colombian Pacific), and to assess potential human health risks related to shark consumption. Seven species were considered in this study: Pelagic Thresher (Alopias pelagicus), Pacific Smalltail Shark (Carcharhinus cerdale), Brown Smoothhound (Mustelus henlei), Sicklefin Smoothhound (Mustelus lunulatus), Scalloped Bonnethead (Sphyrna corona), Scalloped Hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo), and THg was analyzed in shark tissues. 24% muscle samples concentrations were above international recommended limits for human consumption, especially for A. pelagicus and S. lewini. Stable isotopes (δ
65	34740652	Organochlorine pesticides in immature scalloped hammerheads Sphyrna lewini from the western coast of the Gulf of California, Mexico: Bioaccumulation patterns and human exposure.	Despite the intensive use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the proximity of the Gulf of California, there is no information regarding their levels in predatory shark species, which could be exposed to relatively high concentrations. In this area, neonates and juveniles of the critically endangered scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini are caught for consumption, so the examination of the accumulation of OCPs is necessary for future conservation, as well as to assess the exposure to humans. Levels and accumulation patterns of 29 OCPs were analyzed in the liver and muscle of 20 immature scalloped hammerheads. Twenty-three compounds were detected in liver and 17 OCPs were found in muscle. In the latter tissue, only p,p'-DDE presented concentrations above the detection limit in all samples (0.59 ± 0.21 ng/g w.w.), while in the liver, DDTs were also the main group of pesticides (215 ± 317 ng/g w.w.), followed by ∑Chlordanes > ∑Chlorobenzenes > Mirex > HCBD > Others. One of the two analyzed neonates presented high concentrations of OCPs in the liver (1830 ng/g w.w.), attributed to a bioamplification process. No differences in accumulation of OCPs were found between juveniles of both sexes, where an increase in the concentration of various compounds related with size and age was observed. Additionally, juveniles under 2 years of age may undergo a growth dilution process. Our results suggest that the consumption of this species does not imply risks to human health (chronic or carcinogenic effects) associated with OCPs. Likewise, we recommend further monitoring due to the possible recent inputs of some OCPs (e.g. dicofol, median of ratio o, p'-DDT/p, p'-DDT = 0.7) into the environment.
66	34728053	Current and future considerations for shark conservation in the Northeast and Eastern Central Pacific Ocean.	Sharks are iconic and ecologically important predators found in every ocean. Because of their ecological role as predators, some considered apex predators, and concern over the stability of their populations due to direct and indirect overfishing, there has been an increasing amount of work focussed on shark conservation, and other elasmobranchs such as skates and rays, around the world. Here we discuss many aspects of current shark science and conservation and the path to the future of shark conservation in the Northeastern and Eastern Central Pacific. We explore their roles in ecosystems as keystone species; the conservation measures and laws in place at the international, national, regional and local level; the conservation status of sharks and rays in the region, fisheries for sharks in the Northcentral Pacific specifically those that target juveniles and the implications to shark conservation; a conservation success story: the recovery of Great White Sharks in the Northeast Pacific; public perceptions of sharks and the roles zoos and aquariums play in shark conservation; and the path to the future of shark conservation that requires bold partnerships, local stakeholders and innovative measures.
67	34699727	A shark's eye view: testing the 'mistaken identity theory' behind shark bites on humans.	Shark bites on humans are rare but are sufficiently frequent to generate substantial public concern, which typically leads to measures to reduce their frequency. Unfortunately, we understand little about why sharks bite humans. One theory for bites occurring at the surface, e.g. on surfers, is that of mistaken identity, whereby sharks mistake humans for their typical prey (pinnipeds in the case of white sharks). This study tests the mistaken identity theory by comparing video footage of pinnipeds, humans swimming and humans paddling surfboards, from the perspective of a white shark viewing these objects from below. Videos were processed to reflect how a shark's retina would detect the visual motion and shape cues. Motion cues of humans swimming, humans paddling surfboards and pinnipeds swimming did not differ significantly. The shape of paddled surfboards and human swimmers was also similar to that of pinnipeds with their flippers abducted. The difference in shape between pinnipeds with abducted versus adducted flippers was bigger than between pinnipeds with flippers abducted and surfboards or human swimmers. From the perspective of a white shark, therefore, neither visual motion nor shape cues allow an unequivocal visual distinction between pinnipeds and humans, supporting the mistaken identity theory behind some bites.

Regional migration of the copper shark Carcharhinus brachyurus was recorded for the first time in the Southwest Atlantic (SWA) from Argentina (latitude: -38.1037, longitude: -57.5371) to Brazil (latitude: -20.6833, longitude: -40.2846) as a result of a citizen science tagging project. The recaptured specimen was a female (103 kg weight), with 18 developing embryos within the uterus. The total distance was at least 2566 km, and it is the longest ever recorded for the species. Furthermore, it extends its northern distribution in the SWA.
71	34611723	Symbiotic Siphonostomatoida (Copepoda) of the hammerhead shark species Sphyrna zygaena (Carcharhiniformes: Sphyrnidae) and stingray Dasyatis pastinaca  (Myliobatiformes: Dasyatidae) off the Canary Islands, with a re-description of  Pseudocharopinus pillaii Kabata, 1979.	The biology, including accompanying ectoparasitic fauna, remains unstudied for several elasmobranchs off the Canary Islands in spite of concerns over their conservation. Within this region, this is the first report of copepod associations with these fishes. Twenty smooth hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna zygaena, and one common stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca, were inspected for symbionts on their body surface. Symbiotic siphonostomatoids were collected from 18 S. zygaena hosts and represent two different species, i.e., Alebion crassus (Caligidae) and Pandarus cranchii (Pandaridae). A high prevalence of 90% and a mean infection of 8.3 individuals per infected host were exhibited by A. crassus, while only a single P. cranchii was collected. Both these findings represent new geographical records. Additionally, one free-ranging common stingray Dasyatis pastinaca was opportunistically inspected and 11 Pseudocharopinus pillaii (Lernaeopodidae) collected which constitutes a new host record and a new geographical record. A re-description with detail regarding the morphology of the appendages is provided for the first time. Due to the morphological similarity between P. pillaii and P. malleus, a molecular analysis of the partial mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I gene was done in an attempt to determine if there is molecular divergence between the two species. This provided an estimate of the phylogenetic relationships amongst four Pseudocharopinus species (P. bicaudatus, P. pteromylaei, P. malleus, and P. pillaii) with Charopinus dubius as an outgroup as an alternative hypothesis to compare with the previous morphological topology estimated for all Pseudocharopinus species.
72	34610033	Observations of sharks (Elasmobranchii) at Europa Island, a remote marine protected area important for shark conservation in the southern Mozambique Channel.	Sharks have declined worldwide and remote sanctuaries are becoming crucial for shark conservation. The southwest Indian Ocean is a hotspot of both terrestrial and marine biodiversity mostly impacted by anthropogenic damage. Sharks were observed during surveys performed from April to June 2013 in the virtually pristine coral reefs around Europa Island, a remote Marine Protected Area located in the southern Mozambique Channel. Observation events comprised 67 1-hour scientific dives between 5 - 35m depth and 7 snorkeling inspections, as well as 4 dinghy-based observations in the shallow lagoon. In a period of 24 days, 475 sharks were tallied. Carcharhinus galapagensis was most encountered and contributed 20% of the abundance during diving, followed by C. albimarginatus (10%). Both species were more abundant between 11-14h, and on the exposed sides of the island. Numbers of Sphyrna lewini were highest with 370 individuals windward and leeward, mostly schooling. S. lewini aggregations in the area are hypothesized to be attracted to the seamount archipelago offering favorable conditions for deep incursions and of which Europa Island forms part. C. amblyrhynchos, Galeocerdo cuvier and S. mokarran were uncommon, while there was an additional observation of Rhincodon typus. The lagoon of Europa was a nursery ground for C. melanopterus where it was the only species present. A total of 8 species was recorded, contributing to the shark diversity of 15 species reported from Europa since 1952 in the scientific and gray literature. Overall, with the occurrence of several species of apex predators in addition to that of R. typus, large schools of S. lewini, fair numbers of reef sharks and a nursery of C. melanopterus, Europa's sharks constitute a significant reservoir of biodiversity, which contributes to preserve the functioning of the ecosystem. Our observations highlight the relevance of Europa Island for shark conservation and the need for shark-targeted management in the EEZ of both Europa and Bassas da India.
73	34526519	Secondary predation constrains DNA-based diet reconstruction in two threatened shark species.	Increasing fishing effort, including bycatch and discard practices, are impacting marine biodiversity, particularly among slow-to-reproduce taxa such as elasmobranchs, and specifically sharks. While some fisheries involving sharks are sustainably managed, collateral mortalities continue, contributing towards > 35% of species being threatened with extinction. To effectively manage shark stocks, life-history information, including resource use and feeding ecologies is pivotal, especially among those species with wide-ranging distributions. Two cosmopolitan sharks bycaught off eastern Australia are the common blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus; globally classified as Near Threatened) and great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran; Critically Endangered). We opportunistically sampled the digestive tracts of these two species (and also any whole prey; termed the 'Russian-doll' approach), caught in bather-protection gillnets off northern New South Wales, to investigate the capacity for DNA metabarcoding to simultaneously determine predator and prey regional feeding ecologies. While sample sizes were small, S. mokkaran fed predominantly on stingrays and skates (Myliobatiformes and Rajiformes), but also teleosts, while C. limbatus mostly consumed teleosts. Metabarcoding assays showed extensive intermixing of taxa from the digestive tracts of predators and their whole prey, likely via the predator's stomach chyme, negating the opportunity to distinguish between primary and secondary predation. This Russian-doll effect requires further investigation in DNA metabarcoding studies focussing on dietary preferences and implies that any outcomes will need to be interpreted concomitant with traditional visual approaches.
74	34526135	Elasmobranch microbiomes: emerging patterns and implications for host health and ecology.	Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) are of broad ecological, economic, and societal value. These globally important fishes are experiencing sharp population declines as a result of human activity in the oceans. Research to understand elasmobranch ecology and conservation is critical and has now begun to explore the role of body-associated microbiomes in shaping elasmobranch health. Here, we review the burgeoning efforts to understand elasmobranch microbiomes, highlighting microbiome variation among gastrointestinal, oral, skin, and blood-associated niches. We identify major bacterial lineages in the microbiome, challenges to the field, key unanswered questions, and avenues for future work. We argue for prioritizing research to determine how microbiomes interact mechanistically with the unique physiology of elasmobranchs, potentially identifying roles in host immunity, disease, nutrition, and waste processing. Understanding elasmobranch-microbiome interactions is critical for predicting how sharks and rays respond to a changing ocean and for managing healthy populations in managed care.
75	34499686	Evaluating artisanal fishing of globally threatened sharks and rays in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh.	Sharks and rays are at risk of extinction globally. This reflects low resilience to increasing fishing pressure, exacerbated by habitat loss, climate change, increasing value in a trade and inadequate information leading to limited conservation actions. Artisanal fisheries in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh contribute to the high levels of global fishing pressure on elasmobranchs. However, it is one of the most data-poor regions of the world, and the diversity, occurrence and conservation needs of elasmobranchs in this region have not been adequately assessed. This study evaluated elasmobranch diversity, species composition, catch and trade within the artisanal fisheries to address this critical knowledge gap. Findings show that elasmobranch diversity in Bangladesh has previously been underestimated. In this study, over 160000 individual elasmobranchs were recorded through landing site monitoring, comprising 88 species (30 sharks and 58 rays) within 20 families and 35 genera. Of these, 54 are globally threatened according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with ten species listed as Critically Endangered and 22 species listed as Endangered. Almost 98% juvenile catch (69-99% for different species) for large species sand a decline in numbers of large individuals were documented, indicating unsustainable fisheries. Several previously common species were rarely landed, indicating potential population declines. The catch pattern showed seasonality and, in some cases, gear specificity. Overall, Bangladesh was found to be a significant contributor to shark and ray catches and trade in the Bay of Bengal region. Effective monitoring was not observed at the landing sites or processing centres, despite 29 species of elasmobranchs being protected by law, many of which were frequently landed. On this basis, a series of recommendations were provided for improving the conservation status of the elasmobranchs in this region. These include the need for improved taxonomic research, enhanced monitoring of elasmobranch stocks, and the highest protection level for threatened taxa. Alongside political will, enhancing national capacity to manage and rebuild elasmobranch stocks, coordinated regional management measures are essential.
76	34492229	Overfishing drives over one-third of all sharks and rays toward a global extinction crisis.	The scale and drivers of marine biodiversity loss are being revealed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessment process. We present the first global reassessment of 1,199 species in Class Chondrichthyes-sharks, rays, and chimeras. The first global assessment (in 2014) concluded that one-quarter (24%) of species were threatened. Now, 391 (32.6%) species are threatened with extinction. When this percentage of threat is applied to Data Deficient species, more than one-third (37.5%) of chondrichthyans are estimated to be threatened, with much of this change resulting from new information. Three species are Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), representing possibly the first global marine fish extinctions due to overfishing. Consequently, the chondrichthyan extinction rate is potentially 25 extinctions per million species years, comparable to that of terrestrial vertebrates. Overfishing is the universal threat affecting all 391 threatened species and is the sole threat for 67.3% of species and interacts with three other threats for the remaining third: loss and degradation of habitat (31.2% of threatened species), climate change (10.2%), and pollution (6.9%). Species are disproportionately threatened in tropical and subtropical coastal waters. Science-based limits on fishing, effective marine protected areas, and approaches that reduce or eliminate fishing mortality are urgently needed to minimize mortality of threatened species and ensure sustainable catch and trade of others. Immediate action is essential to prevent further extinctions and protect the potential for food security and ecosystem functions provided by this iconic lineage of predators.
77	34476811	Phylogeography and population genetics of the cryptic bonnethead shark Sphyrna aff. tiburo in Brazil and the Caribbean inferred from mtDNA markers.	Resolving the identity, phylogeny and distribution of cryptic species within species complexes is an essential precursor to management. The bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, is a small coastal shark distributed in the Western Atlantic from North Carolina (U.S.A.) to southern Brazil. Genetic analyses based on mitochondrial markers revealed that bonnethead sharks comprise a species complex with at least two lineages in the Northwestern Atlantic and the Caribbean (S. tiburo and Sphyrna aff. tiburo, respectively). The phylogeographic and phylogenetic analysis of two mitochondrial markers [control region (mtCR) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI)] showed that bonnethead sharks from southeastern Brazil correspond to S. aff. tiburo, extending the distribution of this cryptic species >5000 km. Bonnethead shark populations are only managed in the U.S.A. and in the 2000s were considered to be regionally extinct or collapsed in southeast Brazil. The results indicate that there is significant genetic differentiation between S. aff. tiburo from Brazil and other populations from the Caribbean (Φ

The residency and movements of a single acoustically tagged female crested horn shark (Heterodontus galeatus) were monitored in Jervis Bay, Australia. The individual was intermittently detected by receivers throughout the 8-year study period and showed preference for particular rocky reefs in terms of its residency indices and duration of residency events. This individual exhibited lower residency and dissimilar movement patterns to that of the well-studied and sympatric Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), highlighting the need for research into the basic life history and movement ecology of H. galeatus.
79	34457309	Simulated heatwave and fishing stressors alter corticosteroid and energy balance in neonate blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus.	The increasing frequency and duration of marine heatwaves attributed to climate change threatens coastal elasmobranchs and may exacerbate existing anthropogenic stressors. While the elasmobranch stress response has been well studied, the role of the unique corticosteroid-1α-hydroxycorticosterone (1α-OHB)-in energy balance is not understood. Therefore, 1α-OHB's utility as a stress biomarker in elasmobranch conservation physiology is equivocal. Here, we analyse the roles of corticosteroids, 1α-OHB and corticosterone, and metabolites, glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), in response to stress in a protected tropical shark species, the blacktip reef shark (
80	34438648	Reproductive Anatomy of Chondrichthyans: Notes on Specimen Handling and Sperm Extraction. II. Sharks and Chimaeras.	The chondrichthyan fishes, which comprise sharks, rays, and chimaeras, are one of the most threatened groups of vertebrates on the planet. Given this situation, an additional strategy for the protection of these species could be the ex situ conservation projects developed in public aquaria and research centers. Nevertheless, to increase sustainability and to develop properly in situ reintroduction strategies, captive breeding techniques, such as sperm extraction and artificial insemination, should be developed. These techniques are commonly used in other threatened species and could be also used in chondrichthyans. However, the different reproductive morphologies found in this group can complicate both processes. Therefore, a comparison of the reproductive anatomy of eight distinct chondrichthyans, with an emphasis on those important differences when performing sperm extraction or artificial insemination, is carried out herein. Sharks and chimaeras belonging to the Scyliorhinidae, Carcharhinidae, Centrophoridae, Etmopteridae, Hexanchidae, and Chimaeridae families were obtained from commercial fisheries, public aquaria, and stranding events. In addition, the process of obtaining viable sperm samples through cannulation, abdominal massage, and oviducal gland extraction is described in detail for both living and dead animals.

82	34428223	Nation-wide assessment of the distribution and population size of the data-deficient nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum).	The study presents the first national assessment of a nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) population, conducted using a combination of transect surveys and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). Density of nurse sharks in Belize was found to be higher in reefs than in lagoons, and in the atolls furthest away from the mainland and human settlements. Only large and old protected areas were found to have a positive impact on nurse shark abundance. Absolute abundance of nurse sharks was estimated using distance sampling analysis, giving a total nurse shark population in the range of 3,858 to 14,375 sharks. Thanks to a vast area of suitable habitat for nurse sharks in the country and legislation already in place for the safeguard of the species, Belize could represent an important hotspot for nurse sharks in the Western Atlantic. The data presented here hence offers a baseline for the long-term monitoring of the Belizean nurse shark population and improves our understanding of nurse shark abundance and distribution in the wider Caribbean basin.

84	34404844	The role and value of science in shark conservation advocacy.	Many species of sharks are threatened with extinction, and there has been a longstanding debate in scientific and environmental circles over the most effective and appropriate strategy to conserve and protect them. Should we allow for sustainable fisheries exploitation of species which can withstand fishing pressure, or ban all fisheries for sharks and trade in shark products? In the developing world, exploitation of fisheries resources can be essential to food security and poverty alleviation, and global management efforts are typically focused on sustainably maximizing economic benefits. This approach aligns with traditional fisheries management and the perspectives of most surveyed scientific researchers who study sharks. However, in Europe and North America, sharks are increasingly venerated as wildlife to be preserved irrespective of conservation status, resulting in growing pressure to prohibit exploitation of sharks and trade in shark products. To understand the causes and significance of this divergence in goals, we surveyed 155 shark conservation focused environmental advocates from 78 environmental non-profits, and asked three key questions: (1) where do advocates get scientific information? (2) Does all policy-relevant scientific information reach advocates? and (3) Do advocates work towards the same policy goals identified by scientific researchers? Findings suggest many environmental advocates are aware of key scientific results and use science-based arguments in their advocacy, but a small but vocal subset of advocates report that they never read the scientific literature or speak to scientists. Engagement with science appears to be a key predictor of whether advocates support sustainable management of shark fisheries or bans on shark fishing and trade in shark products. Conservation is a normative discipline, and this analysis more clearly articulates two distinct perspectives in shark conservation. Most advocates support the same evidence-based policies as academic and government scientists, while a smaller percentage are driven more by moral and ethical beliefs and may not find scientific research relevant or persuasive. We also find possible evidence that a small group of non-profits may be misrepresenting the state of the science while claiming to use science-based arguments, a concern that has been raised by surveyed scientists about the environmental community. This analysis suggests possible alternative avenues for engaging diverse stakeholders in productive discussions about shark conservation.
85	34403437	Application of biological and fisheries attributes to assess the vulnerability and resilience of tropical marine fish species.	Taking advantage of published data on life-history traits and short-term information on fishery parameters from 3132 records for 644 fish stocks along the coast of India, we calculated resilience (R) and vulnerability (V). Further, we developed an Index of Resilience and Vulnerability (IRV) for 133 species of tropical finfishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Using 7 resilience and 6 vulnerability attributes, two-dimensional scatter plots of the resilience and vulnerability scores were generated and the Euclidean distance and angle from the origin to each point were calculated to determine IRV and the effect of fishing on fish species. By ranking the species, the top 10 highly resilient, highly vulnerable, and high-risk species (low IRV) were identified. While small-sized species with fast growth rate and low trophic level were among the highly resilient species, large predatory species such as sharks and barracudas were among the highly vulnerable and high-risk species. More than 100 of the 133 species were resilient-yet-vulnerable, and most crustaceans showed high resilience. Differences in IRV scores among species within the same family were discernible, indicating the differences in the biological characteristics and response to fishing. Sensitivity analysis indicated that an abridged IRV with 6 attributes works similar to 13 attributes and can be used in data-deficient situations. Comparison of R and V of IRV with other assessments showed different results because of divergences in the objectives, number and types of attributes, and thresholds used. These assessments do not convey the same information and therefore great care must be taken for reproducing these frameworks to other fisheries. The results of IRV analysis can be useful for stock assessments and in developing effective management measures in combination with other complementary information.
86	34402530	A safe haven for potential reproductive aggregations of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish (Pseudobatos horkelii).	Brazilian endemic batoid elasmobranch populations have declined dramatically in the past 40 years due to anthropic activities (e.g., overfishing). The Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii, included in the IUCN red list of endangered species [Critically Endangered (CR)], has been captured as by-catch by trawling fishing boats to the edge of extinction. Despite governmental conservation initiatives, the species is still caught and commercialized along the Brazilian coast. In this study, the authors report three rare aggregation events for the Brazilian coast of P. horkelii, inside the only nearshore no-entry Brazilian marine protected area. Strategies for its protection are also discussed.
87	34382690	The elasmobranchs of Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Colombia.	Management and conservation actions in marine-protected areas require baselines for monitoring threatened marine fauna such as elasmobranchs. This article provides evidence of the occurrence of 34 species of elasmobranchs (21 sharks and 13 batoids) in the Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary, Colombia, including five new records of sharks and three of rays. From 1987 to 2021, new records were obtained by underwater visual census using SCUBA, manned submersibles and deep-ocean cameras to depths of up to 2211 m. Of the recorded species, 21 are considered as threatened taxa (64%) by the IUCN, making the Malpelo Flora and Fauna Sanctuary an essential conservation area for this highly threatened group of species.
88	34374783	Genomic Assessment of Global Population Structure in a Highly Migratory and Habitat Versatile Apex Predator, the Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier).	Understanding the population dynamics of highly mobile, widely distributed, oceanic sharks, many of which are overexploited, is necessary to aid their conservation management. We investigated the global population genomics of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), a circumglobally distributed, apex predator displaying remarkable behavioral versatility in its diet, habitat use (near coastal, coral reef, pelagic), and individual movement patterns (spatially resident to long-distance migrations). We genotyped 242 tiger sharks from 10 globally distributed locations at more than 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Although this species often conducts massive distance migrations, the data show strong genetic differentiation at both neutral (FST = 0.125-0.144) and candidate outlier loci (FST = 0.570-0.761) between western Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sharks, suggesting the potential for adaptation to the environments specific to these oceanic regions. Within these regions, there was mixed support for population differentiation between northern and southern hemispheres in the western Atlantic, and none for structure within the Indian Ocean. Notably, the results demonstrate a low level of population differentiation of tiger sharks from the remote Hawaiian archipelago compared with sharks from the Indian Ocean (FST = 0.003-0.005, P < 0.01). Given concerns about biodiversity loss and marine ecosystem impacts caused by overfishing of oceanic sharks in the midst of rapid environmental change, our results suggest it imperative that international fishery management prioritize conservation of the evolutionary potential of the highly genetically differentiated Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of this unique apex predator. Furthermore, we suggest targeted management attention to tiger sharks in the Hawaiian archipelago based on a precautionary biodiversity conservation perspective.
90	34329051	Nurse sharks, space rockets and cargo ships: Metals and oxidative stress in a benthic, resident and large-sized mesopredator, Ginglymostoma cirratum.	It is widely recognized that apex predators, such as large sharks with highly migratory behavior, are particularly vulnerable to pollution, mainly due to biomagnification processes. However, in highly impacted areas, mesopredator sharks with resident behavior can be as vulnerable as apex sharks. In this context, this study evaluated cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and rubidium (Rb) concentrations, as well as the potentially protective effects of selenium (Se) and the behavior of two non-enzymatic biomarkers, metallothionein (MT) and reduced glutathione (GSH), employing the Atlantic nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum as a study model and compared the results with other resident benthic sharks, as well as highly mobile apex sharks. Muscle tissue samples from 28 nurse sharks opportunistically sampled from the Brazilian Amazon Coast were analyzed. Lower metal concentrations were observed for Pb, Rb and Se in the rainy season, while statistically significant correlations between metals were observed only between Hg and Cd and Pb and Se. Molar ratio calculations indicate potential protective Se effects against Pb, but not against Cd and Hg. No associations between MT and the determined metals were observed, indicating a lack of detoxification processes via the MT detoxification route. The same was noted for GSH, indicating no induction of this primary cellular antioxidant defense. Our results indicate that benthic/mesopredator sharks with resident behavior are, in fact, as impacted as highly mobile apex predators, with the traditional detoxification pathways seemingly inefficient for the investigated species. Moreover, considering the studied population and other literature data, pollution should be listed as a threat to the species in future risk assessments.
91	34321530	Tracking the rising extinction risk of sharks and rays in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.	The loss of biodiversity is increasingly well understood on land, but trajectories of extinction risk remain largely unknown in the ocean. We present regional Red List Indices (RLIs) to track the extinction risk of 119 Northeast Atlantic and 72 Mediterranean shark and ray species primarily threatened by overfishing. We combine two IUCN workshop assessments from 2003/2005 and 2015 with a retrospective backcast assessment for 1980. We incorporate predicted categorisations for Data Deficient species from our previously published research. The percentage of threatened species rose from 1980 to 2015 from 29 to 41% (Northeast Atlantic) and 47 to 65% (Mediterranean Sea). There are as many threatened sharks and rays in Europe as there are threatened birds, but the threat level is nearly six times greater by percentage (41%, n = 56 of 136 vs. 7%, n = 56 of 792). The Northeast Atlantic RLI declined by 8% from 1980 to 2015, while the higher-risk Mediterranean RLI declined by 13%. Larger-bodied, shallow-distributed, slow-growing species and those with range boundaries within the region are more likely to have worsening status in the Northeast Atlantic. Conversely, long-established, severe threat levels obscure any potential relationships between species' traits and the likelihood of worsening IUCN status in the Mediterranean Sea. These regional RLIs provide the first widespread evidence for increasing trends in regional shark and ray extinction risk and underscore that effective fisheries management is necessary to recover the ecosystem function of these predators.
